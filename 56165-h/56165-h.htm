<p>¶ As a humorous commentator upon
morals and manners with special
attention to cats, tutti frutti trees,
Bolshevism for babies and trouser
creases. Mr. Herford leaves nothing
to be desired. His book is a mirror
of engaging frivolity, an incisive
but good-humored thrust at the
follies of the day. Here and there a
very rich and moving note is struck,
as in THE BON DIEU’S BIRTHDAY
PARTY where one finds in full
flower that tender fantasy which is
the greatest charm of Mr. Herford’s
imagination.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SECRET">THE SECRET</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Eve was bored. She confided the fact
to the Serpent.</p>

<p>“Tell me something new!” she wailed, and
the Serpent—he had never seen a lady cry
before—was deeply moved (the Serpent has
always been misjudged) and—there being
no National Board of Censors—told her
everything he knew.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Eve yawned and
looked boreder than ever. “Is <i>that</i> all?”
she said.</p>

<p>The Dramatic Critic asks the same question
on the first night of a new Play—“Will
there never be an end to these Dormitory
Farces,” he moans, pondering darkly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
while how he may transmute its leaden dullness
to the precious gold of a scintillating
paragraph.</p>

<p>Father Time has nothing to say on the
matter. If you ask him to show you a new
thing, he shrugs his wings and growls, “You
can search me.” Things old and things new
are all alike to Father Time.</p>

<p>Peradventure, in the uttermost recess of
the Great Pyramid lies a hair of an unknown
color, or a blueprint of the fourth
dimension, or better still the ms. of a new
play, or a joke that has never been cracked.</p>

<p>When a Roman bath is unearthed in Kent
or a milliner’s shop in Pompeii we wait
breathless to hear of the discovery of a new
story, or a new dress pattern, but always
it is the same old skull, the same old amphora.</p>

<p>Even the newness of Fashion is a jest of
antiquity.</p>

<p>In an Italian book printed in the sixteenth
century is a story of a fool “who went about
the streets naked, carrying a piece of cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
upon his shoulders. He was asked by some
one why he did not dress himself, since he
had the materials. ‘Because’ replied he, ‘I
wait to see in what manner the fashions will
end. I do not like to use my cloth for a
dress which in a little time will be of no use
to me, on account of some new fashion.’”</p>

<p>There may be a newer version of this
story in the ashes of the Alexandrian library
or beneath the ruins of Babylon, but this
has at least the freshness and luster of its
four-hundred years. Also it throws a light,
a very searchlight, on the translucent demoiselles
of today (see them shyly run to cover
at the mere mention of a searchlight.)</p>

<p>Now we know their guilty secret. Each
of them has, hoarded away in a secret
drawer (as money in panicky times) a
roll of fine silk or voile, or panne velvet, or
crepe de chine which she is sparing from the
scissors till the Wheel of Fashion shall oscillate
with less fury. Then she will put away
the skimpy, flimsy makeshift garments of
transformed window curtains and bath towels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
converted <i>robes de nuit</i> and remnants of
net or chiffon she has been vainly trying to
hide behind—and then—then alas, we shall
see her no more!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="OUR_LEISURE_CLASS">OUR LEISURE CLASS</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Once—and not so terribly long ago at
that—we used to be very fond of telling
ourselves (and our visitors from Europe)
that in America we have no Leisure
Class.</p>

<p>That there were people of leisure in our
midst, we could not deny, though we preferred
to call them idle rich, but as for
a special class whose whole business in life
was to abstain from all useful activity—oh,
no!</p>

<p>Even our idle rich, unblest as they are
with the hereditary gift for idling, and untaught
save by a brief generation or two of
acquired experience, find the profession of
Leisure a strenuous not to say noisy task,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
for while those to the leisure born know
by the very feel of it that the habit of idleness
is a perfect fit, the newly-idle must
look for confirmation in the mirror of public
admiration; hence Publicity, the blare of
the Sunday Supplement.</p>

<p>But taken as a class our idle rich (though
it is being rapidly licked or lick-spittled
into shape) is at best an amateur aristocracy
of leisure. For the real thing, for
the genuine hunting, sporting, leisure-loving
American aristocracy, we must go
back to the aboriginal Red Man.</p>

<p>And how the busybody Puritan hated the
Indian! With his air of well-bred taciturnity,
his love of sport, of rest, of nature, and
his belief in a happy Hereafter, the noble
Red Man was in every respect his hateful
opposite, yet if any Pilgrim brother had
dared even to hint that the Indian might
have points of superiority it would have
been the flaming woodpile for him, or something
equally disagreeable in the purifying
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>How different it might have been!</p>

<p>If only the Puritan had been less stuck up
and self-righteous, the Red Man less reserved!
If they could but have understood
that Nature intended them for each other,
these opposites, these complements of each
other.</p>

<p>Why else had Nature brought them together
from the ends of the earth?</p>

<p>But alas, Eugenics had not yet been invented
and the Puritan and the Indian just
naturally hated each other at first sight and
so (like many another match-maker)
Mother Nature slipped up in her calculations,
and a wonderful flower of racial possibility
was forever nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>If the Puritan, with his piety and thrift
and domesticity and his doctrine of election
and the Noble Red Man, with his love of
paint and syncopated music and dancing
and belief in a happy Hereafter, had overcome
their mutual prejudices and instead
of warring with flintlocks and tomahawks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

<h2 id="CONCERNING_REVOLVING">CONCERNING REVOLVING
DOORS.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">There has been some discussion of late
as to the etiquette of the revolving
door. When a man accompanied by a
woman is about to be revolved in it, which
should go first? Some think the man should
precede the woman furnishing the motive
power, while she follows idly in the next
compartment. Others hold that the rule
“Ladies first” can have no exception, therefore
the man must stand aside and let the
female of his species do the rough work of
starting the door’s revolution while the man,
coming after, keeps it going and stops it
at the right moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Starting something” is perhaps of all
pastimes in the world the one most popular
with the sex we are accustomed to call the
gentle sex; one might almost say that “starting
something” is Woman’s prerogative; on
the other hand there is nothing on earth so
abhorrent to that same gentle sex as the
thing that is called Consistency; and though
she may be perfectly charmed to start a
revolution in South America, or in silk pajamas,
or suffrage, or the rearing of children
it does not follow that she will take kindly
to the idea of starting the revolution of a
revolving door.</p>

<p>As for the rule “Ladies first,” its application
to the etiquette of doors in general
(as distinguished from the revolving variety)
is purely a matter of geography. In
some European countries it is the custom,
when entering a room, for the man to precede
the woman, and if it be a closed street
or office door, the man will open it and following
the door inward, hold the door open
while she passes in. If the door opens outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the woman naturally enters first, since
her companion must remain outside to hold
the door open.</p>

<p>The American rule compelling the woman
to precede her escort when entering a room
or building doubtless originated with our
ancestor the cave-man.</p>

<p>On returning to his Apartment with his
wife after a hunting expedition Mr. Hairy
K. Stoneaxe would say with a persuasive
Neolithic smile (and gentle shove) “After
you my dear,” being rewarded for his politeness
by advance information as to whether
there were Megatheriums or Loxolophodons
or an ambuscade of jealous rivals lurking
in the darkness of his stone-upholstered
sitting-room.</p>

<p>By all means let the lady go first; by so
doing we pay the homage that is due to her
sex and even though there are no Megatheriums
of Loxolophodons in these days—there
<i>may</i> be burglars! Only in the case of a door
that must be opened inwards would I suggest
an amendment. What more lamentable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sight than that of a gentle lady squeezing
precariously through a half-opened door
while her escort, determined that though
they both perish in the attempt, she shall
go first, reaches awkwardly past her shoulder
in the frantic endeavor to push back the
heavy self-closing door while at the same
time contorting the rest of his person into
the smallest possible compass that she may
have room to pass without disaster to her
ninety-dollar hat, not to speak of her elbows
and shins.</p>

<p>How much happier—and happiness is the
mainspring of etiquette—they would be,
this same pair, if (with a possible “allow me”
to calm her fears) the escort should push
boldly the door to its widest openness and
holding it thus with one hand behind his
back, with the other press his already removed
hat against his heart as the lady
grateful and unruffled sweeps majestically
by.</p>

<div class="verse">“That babies don’t commit such crimes as forgery is true,</div>
<div class="verse">But little sins develop, if you leave them to accrue;</div>
<div class="verse">For anything you know, they’ll represent, if you’re alive,</div>
<div class="verse">A burglary or murder at the age of thirty-five.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When W. S. Gilbert wrote these
lines, he stated in an amusing way
a great truth, for the doctrine of infant depravity
and original sin thus lightly touched
upon is, when stripped of its Calvinistic
mummery, a recognized scientific verity.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that if the “highbrow”
mothers who turn to books by long-haired
professors with retreating chins for advice
in child training, should study instead the
nonsensical wisdom of Gilbert’s book, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
would derive more benefit therefrom. At
least it would do them (and their children)
no harm.</p>

<p>I wish as much as that could be said of a
book I have lately come across entitled
“Practical Child Training,” by Ray C.
Beery (Parent’s Association). So far from
harmless it is, in my opinion, a more fitting
title for it would be “Bolshevism for
Babies.”</p>

<p>Obedience, says the author, “is your corner-stone.
Therefore lay it carefully.”
And this is how it is laid: “<i>While you are
teaching the child the first lessons in correct
obedience, do not give any commands either
in the lesson or outside except those which
the child will be sure to obey willingly.</i>”</p>

<p>Obedience is to be taught by wheedling
and cajolery, which lessons the clever child
will apply in later life as bribery and corruption.
The author denies this in Book
I, p. 130, but his denial is so curious it deserves
quoting: “<i>You would entirely vitiate
its principles if in giving this lesson you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
should state it to the child like this: ‘If you
do not do thus and so, I will give you no
candy.</i>’” Then on the same page: “<i>While
the thought of candy in the child’s mind
causes him to obey, yet the lesson is planned
in such a way that you are not buying obedience.</i>”</p>

<p>The “five principles of discipline” are embodied
in the following story: The father
of a boy sees him and two other boys throwing
apples through a barn window, two of
whose panes had been broken. To make a
long story short, the parent, instead of reproving
his offspring, says: “Good shot,
Bob! Do you see that post over there? See
if you can hit it two out of three times.” “It
would have been unwise for that father
(adds the author of “Practical Child Training”)
to say, ‘I’d rather you’d not throw
at that window opening—can’t you sling at
something else?’ The latter remark would
suggest that the window was the best target
and the boys would have been dissatisfied at
having to stop throwing at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The inference that the boys only needed
the father’s objection to an act on their part
to convince them that it was a desirable
act would be ludicrous if it weren’t so immoral.</p>

<p>If you ask me which disgusts me most,
the Father or his sons, I should reply without
a moment’s hesitation—the Author of
the book!</p>

<h2 id="THE_TUTTI-FRUTTI_TREE">THE TUTTI-FRUTTI TREE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">When the author of the most famous
Love Song ever written, cried,
“There is no new thing under the sun,”
cigarettes, chewing-gum, the thermos-bottle
and the “snapper” for fastening ladies’
frocks—(an indispensable thing when one
has several hundred wives)—were yet to be
invented.</p>

<p>Neither so far as we can learn, had Solomon
who knew and could address in its own
language every flower and tree in existence,
ever heard of the Tutti-Frutti Tree.</p>

<p>There is to my certain belief only one tree
in existence answering to that name, and I
christened it myself. I am its Godfather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In the heartmost heart of the fruitful
Paradise of New Jersey stands a small but
ancient stone cottage that has come to regard
me as its lord, and on Squire Williams’
estate, whose verdant acres lie just outside
my garden fence, grows the Tutti-Frutti
Tree.</p>

<p>Once it was a young Apple Tree. It is
still young, but as the result of a series of
sap transfusions it is also several other
kinds of tree, and when it grows up it will
bear apples, quinces, two kinds of pears,
peaches and, I believe, plums—almost
everything in fact except Water Melons.</p>

<p>Some day a future Stevenson will immortalize
it in verse something after this fashion,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>The Tutti-Frutti Tree so bright,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>It gives me fruit with all its might,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Apples, peaches, pears and quinces,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I’m sure we should all be happy as princes.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It’s quite absurd, of course, but just suppose
the Tree of Knowledge in that First
Garden has been a Tutti-Frutti Tree instead
of an Apple Tree! With seven separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
kinds of fruit to choose from, all
equally forbidden and, for that reason,
equally desirable, how could Eve ever have
decided which one to pluck?</p>

<p>And with Eve’s hesitation Sin would have
been lost to the world!</p>

<p>Let us give thanks that the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil was <i>not</i> a
Tutti-Frutti Tree.</p>

<h2 id="THOSE_BILL-BOARDS">THOSE BILL-BOARDS</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Every now and again, generally when
the warm weather is upon us, somebody
or other starts a heated discussion
about something that is of no particular interest
to anybody.</p>

<p>This time it is Mr. Joseph Pennell, the
artist, who wails and gnashes his pen about
the terrible bill-board and advertising pictures
that deface the public buildings and
thoroughfares of American cities and the
public scenery of the American countryside.</p>

<p>If my opinion were asked I should be
tempted to quote the gentle answer with
which the late William D. Howells was wont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to turn away argument, and say to Mr. Pennell,
“I think perhaps you are partly right.”</p>

<p>But since I am not on Mr. Pennell’s list
of great American artists, a list, by the way
that contains only two names, I am free to
say what I really think, and that is that if
the dear old familiar “Ads” were suddenly
to disappear from the streets and cars, I
should miss them very much.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have acquired a taste for them
as the dweller near a street railroad first endures,
then tolerates, and at last becomes so
completely habituated to the roaring of
wheels and the clang of metal that he is unable
to sleep without their soothing lullaby.</p>

<p>Soothing—that’s what they are, these advertising
pictures. They soften the underground
torment of travel in the Subway,
they take the place of the scenery which beguiles
the tedium of ordinary travel, and at
least they are, as a rule, more interesting to
contemplate than the people in the opposite
seat. Those people are strangers, the people
in the advertisement panels are, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of them, old friends, friends met in other
cars in other cities. Mr. Pennell no doubt
would like to see them thrown off the train,
but I am always glad to meet them again,
and to some of them, with whom I have a
sort of informal bowing acquaintance, I
mentally take off my hat.</p>

<p>One amiable gentleman in particular I
always look for and hail with delight when
I find myself sitting opposite to him. He
is an Italian, I take it, from his appearance,
and from Naples, to judge by his accent,
which, though I have never heard his voice, is
depicted as plainly as the nose on his face.</p>

<p>Neither do I know his name, but I call
him Signor Pizzicato, for it is quite evident
that nature intended him for an Operatic
career. How he ever came to be a barber,
I cannot imagine. Perhaps he sang in the
Barber of Seville and lost his voice and became
a realist, as some painters lose their
sense of form and become cubists or futurists.
Whatever he should have been or
might have been or was, a barber is what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is now, and I gaze upon him in fascination
as with a priceless gesture of thumb and
forefinger (as if he should pluck an individual
mote from a sunbeam) he extols to his
customer and to you, the bouquet so ravishing
of the hair tonic he holds in his other
hand, on the sale of which he presumably
receives a large commission.</p>

<p>Then there is that delightful little Miss
clad in airy next-to-nothings—but no, on
second thought I shall not introduce you to
her. I fear she is not to be trusted. The
last time I sat opposite to her in a street-car
in Cleveland—(or was it in Buffalo)—she
caused me to go five blocks past my destination
which happened to be a railway station,
so that I was two blocks late for my train.</p>

<p>All I will tell you about her, gentle reader,
is that she has fringed gentian eyes with a
look in them that says quite plainly nothing
would gratify her more than to play the
same trick upon you.</p>

<p>All this chatter, I am aware, has nothing
to do with Art, that is to say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“Art of Painting”; that large, severe-looking
female you sometimes see crouched in
an uncomfortable position on a still more
uncomfortable cornice of a public building,
wearing a laurel wreath and a granite peplum,
and holding in her hand a huge stone
palette.</p>

<p>But sometimes this severe female climbs
down from her stone perch and takes a day
off, Coney Island-wise, on the billboards
and street cars, and then if she is not always
at her best, she is often very amusing.</p>

<p>And just because a goddess isn’t stuck
up it doesn’t prove that she isn’t a goddess—does
it?</p>

<h2 id="THE_LURE_OF_THE_AD">THE LURE OF THE “AD”</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Kipling once, when sojourning in a
far country, complained bitterly of the
thoughtlessness of his friends at home in
sending him a batch of magazines shorn (to
save postage) of all the advertisements.
Which shows that the most grown-up of
artists may still have the heart of a child.</p>

<p>For my part, if I were forced to make
choice between the advertising pages and the
reading matter (so-called), I should in nine
periodicals out of ten choose the former.</p>

<p>To the grown-up child the advertising
section of the magazine takes the place of
the Shop-Window of infancy through
which, with bulging eyes and mouth agape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
like some mazed minnow staring at the submerged
Rhine-Gold, he once gazed at the
tinsel treasure so bitterly beyond his penny’s
reach.</p>

<p>And now, just as far out of reach as ever,
in the display-window of the advertising
page, the grown-up child gazes at the miraculous
Motor-Car gliding, velvet shod,
through palmy solitudes reflecting the rays
of the setting sun with a splendor out-Solomoning
Solomon.</p>

<p>Or the “Home Beautiful,” constructed
throughout of selected materials of distinctive
quality, and roofed with spark-proof
shingles of the most refined pastel tints,
“<i>just the home you have dreamed about at
a price that will dumfound you! Enclose
this coupon with your order.</i>”</p>

<p>Again it is the magical cabinet that
brings into your very lap as it were the
Galli-Curci, the Tetrazzini or any other
“ini,” “owski” or “elli” it may please your
fancy to pick from its golden perch in the
operatic aviary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>And what a relief to turn from the
magazine pictures of the slick-haired hero
and the slinky heroine of fiction (perpetually
<i>vis-à-vis</i> yet always looking past
each other)—to turn from these to the very
attractive, intelligent-looking girls of the advertising
pages, girls exquisitely coiffed,
gowned and silk-hosed and ever happily employed
in some useful task: this one (in the
Paquin “trottoir” of mouse-colored voile)
joyously propelling a vacuum-cleaner, this
(in the afternoon toilette of tricolette) mixing
the ingredients for a custard pie in a
forget-me-not-blue Wedgwood bowl, and
this, not less lovely than either of her sisters,
polishing a bathtub with some magic powder
till it glistens like a Childs’ restaurant.</p>

<p>Now, any one of these dear girls, on her
face alone—not to mention her graceful carriage
and delicately moulded stockings—might
without the least effort in the world
have obtained a position as a Star in a Musical
Comedy—with her picture in the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>
or <i>Vanity Fair</i> at least once a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fortnight—but she prefers the simple household
task, the vacuum cleaner, the spotless oil-stove,
the shining bathtub to the plaudits
of the masses.</p>

<p>And this is only one of the many lessons
that are to be learned from the advertising
pages. Who can look at the busy little
Dutch lady in the blue frock and white cap
and apron, stick in hand, chasing the Demon
Dirt in street cars, subway and elevated stations,
billboards and electric signs, all over
town, all over the continent for that matter—who
can look at the determined back of
that fierce little lady (no one has ever seen
her face, save the Demon) without inwardly
swearing that wherever Demon Dirt may
show his face, whether it be on the stage, the
picture screen or the printed page of fiction
he will do unto him even as doth the Little
Dutch Lady with the big stick—</p>

<p>Or is it a rolling pin?</p>

<h2 id="LOOK_BEFORE_SHE_LEAPS">LOOK BEFORE SHE LEAPS</h2>

<p class="dropcap">The Fourteenth of February in Leap
Year is a dread-letter day for the
shrinking bachelor and the shy (wife-shy)
grass widower.</p>

<p>The butterfly-winged statue of Femininity
that, for three happy leapless years, he
worshiped from a safe distance (at the foot
of its pedestal), has come to life, has climbed
down from its vestal perch, changed fearfully
from cool quiet marble to something
of the consistency of warm india rubber—from
an adorable image to—the female of
the species.</p>

<p>And with all the term implies. The butterfly
wings of Psyche, iridescent, like rainbows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
reflected on mother-of-pearl, have
shrivelled and blackened into the umbrella-ribbed
wings of the vampire and the petalled
lips from which could only be thought to
issue the maidenly negative “yes” or the
melting affirmative “no”—are twisted into
little scarlet snakes that hiss, “Kisssss me my
fool!”</p>

<p>“Look before she leaps!” is the Leap-Year
slogan of the shrinking Bachelor, and
it is a perfectly splendid motto, as mottoes
go.</p>

<p>But a motto is like a cure for a cold which
is only good to cure a cold that has not yet
been caught, and the shrinking one is already
as good as caught and his perfectly
splendid slogan is of no more use than an
icebox to an Esquimaux or a fur coat in
Hell.</p>

<p>The Leap-Year Bachelor’s only hope is to
feign death. Like the Bear in Æsop, the
Female of the Species Human has no use
for any but a “live one.”</p>

<p>If he flees he is lost—(or found, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to whether the speech be given to the male or
the female actor of the scene,)—and if he be
a grass widower, he is made hay while the
sun shines.</p>

<p>Now whether Providence intended the instinct
of flight for the preservation of the
hunted one or as a stimulus to the hunter,
will never be known. With wolves and
tigers it works both ways, but with the leap-year
“Vamp” it works pretty much only one
way.</p>

<p>And so the gentle bachelor flees and is
caught and is lived upon happily ever
after⸺</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>To see a statue come to life must be a
terrifying spectacle. Ovid’s tale of Pygmalion
and Galatea is only for those who
get their ideas about artists from magazines
to the vacuity of whose contents the
face of the girl on the cover may well serve
as an index.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that when Pygmalion
saw his perfect marble (perfect to him anyway)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
turn to imperfect flesh and blood, the
completed result of months of hard work obliterated—undone—as
if it had never been—and
in its place “just a girl,” very sweet
and lovely and all that—but compared to
his statue—oh no!</p>

<p>And that is looking at it from its brightest
“angle” (as the motion-picture intellectuals
say). As a matter of fact, judging from
the agonizing sensation of the human leg
(or arm) when rudely awakened from
dreamless slumber, the process of transmutation
from senseless stone to pulsating
flesh must be a very painful one indeed.
However pleasing the countenance of the
living Galatea might be under normal conditions
its expression of mingled bewilderment,
rage and physical anguish must have
been disconcerting, not to say terrifying, to
the sensitive soul of the sculptor, and anything
but consoling for the loss of his hard-won
and cherished handiwork.</p>

<p>I can picture Pygmalion fleeing madly
from his studio, not even waiting for the elevator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and vowing by all the gods, then administrating
human affairs, never again to
make a wish without touching wood or at
least crossing his fingers.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LOW_COST_OF_CABBING">THE LOW COST OF CABBING</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In the last ten years or so all the necessaries
and most of the luxuries of life
have more than doubled in cost—all but one—the
Cab—or to be more accurate, the
Taxi-cab.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because a cab is quite as
often a necessity as it is a luxury and so
falls between two schools, the Stoic and Epicurean,
that it is an exception to the rule of
rising cost.</p>

<p>Did I say rising cost? If I am not very
much mistaken the cost of cabbing, so far
from not rising <i>has actually fallen</i> in the last
ten years, and that brings me to my great invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a scheme for saving money, a Thrift
scheme. It is like this—Every time you
take a street-car (what with the dislocated
service and the abolition of transfers) you
are paying nearly twice what you used to
pay, and soon you will be paying even more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a trip that in a hackney
cab, fifteen years ago, cost you a dollar-fifty,
today in a taxicab costs you only
seventy-five cents.</p>

<p>Now make a swift calculation—</p>

<p>If you take six cars a day you lose thirty
cents. A loss of thirty cents a day doesn’t
seem very much, but in a year, it amounts
to a loss of $109.50 which is not to be treated
lightly.</p>

<p>Now if you take six Taxis at an average
cost of, say two dollars per trip, you are
saving (let me see, six times two) twelve
dollars a day and twelve dollars a day is four
thousand three hundred and eighty dollars
a year, which added to the $109.50 you have
saved by not riding in street-cars makes a
grand total of $4489.50! And this is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what you save by taking six cabs a day. If
you took twice as many cabs <i>you would save
twice that amount</i>, and if you increased your
cabbage to one hundred per diem (a day)
your savings for the first year would amount
to $448,950.50—nearly half a million dollars!</p>

wife when she returns from business this evening—It
is a live proposition—Think
it over!</p>

<h2 id="THE_GREAT_MATCH-BOX">THE GREAT MATCH-BOX MYSTERY</h2>

<h3>PART ONE</h3>

<p>I wonder—has any one ever made a
psychoanalytical study of the habits of
the Match-box family?</p>

<p>By Match-box family I mean the yellow
and black, self-sufficient variety that arrive
from the grocer in packages of a dozen and
are at once torn apart and distributed (like
kittens or missionaries) to every point of the
compass.</p>

<p>Each box has its own special territory, and
there it should stand, ready to the last
match for any sudden emergency, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the re-animation of the just-gone-out pipe,
or the finding of the eyeglasses in the dark
that their owner may be able to read the
time on his radium-faced wrist-watch, or a
thousand and one things.</p>

<p>There are indeed a thousand and one
good and sufficient reasons (apart from its
being its plain duty) why a match-box
should always be on the job, and like the
thousand and one cures for rheumatism not
one of them (unless it be a horse-chestnut
in the pocket) can be relied upon to work.</p>

<p>I sometimes think “a thousand and one”
must be an unlucky number.</p>

<p>The greater the need of its services the
less likely is the match-box to be in that particular
place where any number of witnesses
will testify upon oath they had seen it only a
moment before.</p>

<p>What is the strikeology of it? Have
match-boxes that perverted sense of humor
that finds expression in practical jokes?
No, it is nothing like that. Would that it
were! It is something less easy to explain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
It is something sinister—something rather
frightening.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>I am a devout reader of detective stories
and with much study of their methods
have come to regard myself as something of
a sleuth, in a purely theoretic way of course;
nevertheless I have always hoped some day
to put my theories to the test, and here was
the chance. <i>I would find out where the
match-boxes go</i>, I would follow their trail
to the bitter end, even if it led to the door of
the White House itself!</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>First I made a careful blue-print plan of
the flat in which I (and the match-boxes)
live, marking plainly in red ink all the doors,
windows, fire-escapes (fire-escapes are most
important); dumbwaiters, closets, trapdoors
(there weren’t any but I put them in to
make it more professional); then—but why
go into all the thousand and—there’s that
unlucky number again—the thousand and
two minute and uninteresting details? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
would only skip them and turn to the last
paragraph to end the horrible suspense and
learn at once what I discovered. * * *</p>

<h3>PART TWO</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Synopsis of Previous Chapter.</i> Having
observed that Match-boxes, placed in every
room of the house, invariably disappear in
a few hours, the narrator resolves to solve
the mystery even though the trail should
lead straight to the White House in Washington.
Accordingly he makes a plan of
all the rooms, closets, etc., and searches
every possible hiding-place, but no trace
of the Match-boxes is found.</p>

</div>

<p>What can have become of them! I have
searched every corner of every room in
the house—Stay! There is one room I have
overlooked—the Haunted Room in the West
Corridor, haunted by the ghosts of dead
cigarettes, unfinished poems and murdered
ideas. It is my study (or studio, as the occasion
may be). With trembling hand on
the porcelain door-knob, I pause to recall
the secret combination.</p>

<p>In vain I rack my brain to remember the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
secret combination of my study door. Then
suddenly it flashes upon me that long ago I
wrote it down in the address book I carried
in my pocket.</p>

<p>There are twelve pockets in the suit I am
wearing. Fearfully I go through the twelve
pockets and many are the lost treasures and
forgotten-to-mail letters I find, but no Address
Book! Wait! there is still another
pocket! One I never use—<span class="smcapuc">THE THIRTEENTH
POCKET</span>!</p>

<p>With the deliberation of despair I empty
the Thirteenth Pocket of its contents—a
broken cigarette, two amalgamated postage
stamps, a device for cleaning pipe bowls,
some box-checks for <i>The Famous Mrs. Fair</i>,
four rubber bands, a fragment of an Erie
time-table and—the Address Book!</p>

<p>On the last page of the Address Book is
the Combination, written in a pale Greek
cipher, but still legible, grasping the porcelain
door-knob firmly between my thumb
and four fingers I scan the cipher eagerly.
De-coded, it reads as follows—<i>Twist knob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the right as far as possible and push door.</i></p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>With heart beating like a typewriter I
obeyed the directions to the letter, and to my
intense relief the door yielded and in another
moment I was in the room!</p>

<p>And there, scattered over the surface of
my desk like surprised conspirators, feigning
ignorance of one another’s presence,
were twelve yellow Match-boxes!</p>

<p>How they mastered the combination of the
door and got into the room, I shall not attempt
to explain. I am only an amateur
Detective.</p>

<p>All I know is that Match-boxes, though
they be scattered to the ends of the house
(or World), always get together in some
one place.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is for safety, they get together.</p>

<p>I have always wondered why they are
called Safety Matches.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is the reason!</p>

<h2 id="ARE_CATS_PEOPLE">ARE CATS PEOPLE?</h2>

<p class="dropcap">If a fool be sometimes an angel unawares,
may not a foolish query be a momentous
question in disguise? For example, the old
riddle: “Why is a hen?” which is thought
by many people to be the silliest question
ever asked, is in reality the most profound.
It is the riddle of existence. It has an answer,
to be sure, but though all the wisest
men and women in the world <i>and</i> Mr. H. G.
Wells have tried to guess it, the riddle
“Why is a hen?” has never been answered
and never will be. So, too, the question:
“Are Cats People?” seemingly so trivial,
may be, under certain conditions, a question
of vital importance.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, a rich man dies, leaving all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his money to his eldest son, with the proviso
that a certain portion of it shall be spent
in the maintenance of his household as it
then existed, all its members to remain under
his roof, and receive the same comfort, attention,
or remuneration they had received in
his (the testator’s) lifetime. Then suppose
the son, on coming into his money, and being
a hater of cats, made haste to rid himself of
a feline pet that had lived in the family
from early kittenhood, and had been an especial
favorite of his father’s.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the second son, being a lover
of cats and no hater of money, sues for possession
of the estate on the ground that his
brother has failed to carry out the provisions
of his father’s will, in refusing to maintain
the household cat.</p>

<p>The decision of the case depends entirely
on the social status of the cat.</p>

<p>Shall the cat be considered as a member
of the household? What constitutes a
household anyway?</p>

<p>The definition of “Household” in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Standard Dictionary is as follows: “<i>A
number of persons living under the same
roof.</i>”</p>

<p>If cats are people, then the cat in question
is a person and a member of the household,
and for failing to maintain her and
provide her with the comfort and attention
to which she has been used, the eldest son
loses his inheritance. Having demonstrated
that the question “Are Cats People?” is anything
but a trivial one, I now propose a
court of inquiry, to settle once for all and
forever, the social status of <i>felis domesticus</i>.</p>

<p>And I propose for the office of judge of
that court—myself!</p>

<p>In seconding the proposal and appointing
myself judge of the court, I have been careful
to follow political precedent by taking
no account whatever of any qualifications I
may or may not have for the office.</p>

<p>For witnesses, I summon (from wherever
they may be) two great shades, to wit: King
Solomon, the wisest man of his day, and
Noah Webster, the wordiest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>And I say to Mr. Webster, “Mr. Webster,
what are the common terms used to
designate a domestic feline whose Christian
name chances to be unknown to the
speaker?” and Mr. Webster answers without
a moment’s hesitation:</p>

<p>“Cat, puss, pussy and pussy-cat.”</p>

<p>“And what is the grammatical definition
of the above terms?”</p>

<p>“They are called nouns.”</p>

<p>“And what, Mr. Webster, is the accepted
definition of a noun?”</p>

<p>“A noun is the name of a person, place or
thing.”</p>

<p>“Kindly define the word ‘place’.”</p>

<p>“A particular locality.”</p>

<p>“And ‘thing’.”</p>

<p>“An inanimate object.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Mr. Webster.”</p>

<p>So, according to Mr. Noah Webster, the
entity for which the noun cat stands, must, if
not a person, be a locality or an inanimate
object!</p>

<p>A cat is surely not a locality, and as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
being an inanimate object, her chance of
avoiding such a condition is nine times better
even than a king’s.</p>

<p>Then a cat <i>must</i> be a person.</p>

<p>Suppose we consult King Solomon.</p>

<p>In the Book of Proverbs, Chapter XXX,
verse 26, Solomon says: “The coneys are but
a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in
the rocks.”</p>

<p>A coney is a kind of rabbit; folk, according
to Mr. Webster, only another word for
people.</p>

<p>That settles it! If the rabbits are people,
cats are people.</p>

<p>Long lives to the cat!</p>

<h2 id="MLLE_FAUTEUIL">MLLE. FAUTEUIL</h2>

<p class="dropcap">It is harder for a table or chair to behave
naturally on the stage than for a camel
to be free and easy in a needle’s eye, or for
Mr. Rockefeller to get into Heaven (or
Hell?) with the money.</p>

<p>What can be more pathetic than the spectacle
of a helpless young chair or table or
settee starting on a stage career shining
with gilt varnish and high ambition to reflect
in art’s mirror the drawing-room manners
of the furniture of real life.</p>

<p>Mlle. Fauteuil (that is her stage name,
in private life she is just plain Sofa) is
fresh, charming and of the best manufacture.
She appears nightly in a Broadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
theater, yet she has attracted no attention.
She has received no press notices.</p>

<p>Certainly this is from no lack of charm on
her part. Her legs are delightful. In the
contemplation of their gilded curves, one
scarcely notices that she has no arms or that
her back is slightly curved, and her upholstery,
a brocade of the season before last.</p>

<p>In a hushed papièr-mâché voice the property
man told me the story of Mlle. Fauteuil’s
persecution—how, at the first rehearsal
with scenery, she occupied a perfectly
proper position between the center table and
the bay window, how the Leading Lady insisted
on her being moved as she obstructed
that superior person’s path when, after writing
the letter, she crosses to the window to
see if her Husband is in the garden.</p>

<p>Mlle. Fauteuil was then transferred to
a station between the table and the fire-place.
This was all right, until the scene between
the Husband and Wife, when the Husband
walks back and forth (quickly up stage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
slowly down stage), <i>between the table and
the fire-place</i>.</p>

<p>This time it was not a case of politely requesting
the intervention of the stage-manager.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>Poor mangled Fauteuil! When she was
picked up from the orchestra pit where he
had thrown her it was found that two of her
rungs were fractured and her left castor was
broken clean off at the ankle.</p>

<p>After half a day in the hospital without
either anesthetics, flowers or press notices,
she reappeared on the left side of the stage,
between the center table and the safe. Here
she was conspicuous and happy until it was
found that the Erring Son in his voyage
from the window to the safe, was compelled
to take a difficult step to one side to avoid
the fauteuil.</p>

<p>Bandied from right to left, up stage and
down stage, at last Mlle. Fauteuil landed in
her present obscure position, to the right of
the stairway pillar, where, though miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
obscure, she interferes with nobody’s stage
business.</p>

<p class="break">In the interior set as now played there is
only one chair with a speaking part—this
is, the Jacobean chair on which the leading
man leans when talking to the ingénue. In
the first act, it faces left so that he may
show his favorite profile. In the second act,
the chair is reversed in order that the audience
may enjoy his more popular and extensively
photographed left profile.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is that the furniture
on the stage must never appear more
intelligent than the actors.</p>

<h2 id="MONEY_AND_FIREFLIES">MONEY AND FIREFLIES</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Oh, yes, Money talks. We all know
that, and a very noisy talker it is and
very harsh and metallic is its accent. But
sometimes money talks in a whisper, so low
that it can hardly be heard.</p>

<p>Then is the time it should be watched, even
if spies and dictaphones must be set upon it.
The money whose eloquence, we are told,
wished the shackles of Prohibition on this
land of the free, talked with such a “still
small voice” that everybody (except you and
me, dear Reader) mistook it for the voice of
conscience.</p>

<p>Speaking of money perhaps you don’t
know it, but it is nevertheless true, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
light given off by one of the many species of
Firefly is the most efficient light known, being
produced at about one four-hundredth
part of the cost of the energy which is expended
in the candle flame. That is what
William J. Hammer says in his book on
Radium, giving as his authority Professor
S. P. Langley and F. W. Very.</p>

<p>And Sir Oliver Lodge says if the secret of
the Firefly were known, a boy turning a
crank could furnish sufficient energy to light
an entire electric circuit.</p>

<p>But to the Casual Observer there is only
one variety of Firefly.… Like Wordsworth’s
primrose:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Firefly with fitful glim</div>
<div class="verse">Is just a Lightning Bug to him</div>
<div class="verse">And it is nothing more.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In reality there are almost as many different
kinds of Firefly in the United States
alone as there are varieties of the great
American Pickle.</p>

<p>The late Professor Hagen of Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
College, it is said, when enjoying the beauties
of Nature one night in the company
of the Casual Observer, was aroused from
an apparent reverie by the question “Have
you noticed the Fireflies, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Professor Hagen, “I have
already counted thirteen distinct species.”</p>

<p>Another quite different story is told of a
well-known English actress—Cecilia Loftus,
if you insist on knowing her name. It
was her first visit to America and Miss Loftus
was sitting with another Casual Observer
on the piazza of a country house whose
grounds were separated from the road by a
belt of trees.</p>

<p>“Do you see the Fireflies?” said the Casual
Observer, pointing toward the road.</p>

<p>“Fireflies!” exclaimed Cecilia, “why, I
thought they were hansom-cab lights!”</p>

<h2 id="CONCERNING_THE_TROUSER-CREASE">CONCERNING THE TROUSER-CREASE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">It may perchance be questioned how long
Britannia shall continue to rule the
waves, but that she will ever cease to rule the
fashions (the male fashions, I mean) is beyond
the dreams of the boldest tailor or the
maddest hatter.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, every rule has its exception
and the Rule of Fashion is no exception to
the rule that rules that every rule has its
exception.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, since the invention
of trousers, one or another English King
has ruled that the human trouser-crease shall
crown the Eastern and Western slope instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the Northern and Southern exposure
of the trouser-leg.</p>

<p>The law has never been considered by
Parliament, for even the most radical
House of Commons would balk at legislation
so subversive of individual freedom, but
by word of mouth, by courier, by post, by
cable, by wireless, by airplane the edict has
passed through all the nations and all the
tribes to the trousermost ends of the earth.</p>

<p>And with what result?</p>

<p>With no result whatever. As far as it
has been possible to push inquiry, it is safe
to say that no trouserian biped bearing the
mark of a lateral crease has been met with
in any quarter of the Globe, or, for that matter,
ever will be.</p>

<p>Strange, is it not, that the Tailors (proverbially
the most complacent, not to say
timid, of men) should, without any plan or
program or fuss or demonstration of any
sort, unite as one man—or rather one tailor—and
refuse to obey the unlimited monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the male fashions of the civilized world.
What is the explanation?</p>

<p>There are two explanations. One is Commercialism.</p>

<p>There is no profit to be made out of a
change in the geography of a trouser-crease.
It is purely a matter of self-determination
on the part of the inhabitant of the trousers.</p>

<p>If there were no more financial profit to
be gained by the remaking of the creases in
the map of Europe than is to be got out of
changing the trouser-crease, there would be
no call for a League of Nations.</p>

<p>Should some inventive tailor (<i>inventive
tailor!</i>) devise a crease that could be woven
into the very being of the Trouser, then it
would be a very different matter. The
slightest variation in the location of the
crease would cause an upheaval in the (I’m
tired of the word Trouser)—in the “Pant”
market that would mean millions of dollars
to the trade.</p>

<p>As it is there is no money in it.</p>

<p>The other explanation is that the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
King Edward or King George creasing
the Royal Pants in any but the usual place
is made out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>But let us suppose for a moment (just
for the fun of the thing) that in some possible
scheme or caprice of creation there
<i>were</i> such a thing as an inventive tailor.</p>

<p>And the inventive tailor invented a permanent
trouser-crease and planted it on the
Eastern and Western frontiers of the trouser-legs.</p>

<p>What would be the probable effect of the
innovation on the trouser-bearing species of
the human race?</p>

<p>In that process of advancing alternate
trouser-legs we call locomotion do we not
consciously, or unconsciously, follow in the
direction indicated by the point of the
crease?</p>

<p>What then would happen if the crease
were transferred from the front to the sides?</p>

<p>The Crab alone of all living creatures exhibits
in its legs a formation that corresponds
to the human trouser-crease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>This ridge-like formation or crease occurs
in the <i>side</i> of the Crab’s legs, not in the
front as in the human species!</p>

<p>And the slogan of the Crab (as everyone
knows) is, “First make sure you’re right
<i>and then go sideways</i>.”</p>

<p>Shall we too go sideways?</p>

<p class="break">Charlie Chaplin is the only human creature
whose feet go East and West as his
face travels North and his trouser-creases
are so complicated it would be difficult to
classify them.</p>

<p>Perhaps they hold the secret of his centrifugal
orientation, his inexplicable fascination.</p>

<p>Who knows!</p>

<h2 id="AN_OLD-FASHIONED_HEAVEN">AN OLD-FASHIONED HEAVEN</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We have to thank an Anglican clergyman,
the Rev. G. Vale Owen, for
the latest description of the Future Life of
our species. Impelled by a “gentle, steady
but accumulative force” this good man became
the unwilling amanuensis of the spirit
of his mother and “other friends” and has
written a description of the houses, trees,
bridges, gardens and people of the other
world and their occupations that could
scarcely be improved upon by the most imaginative
motion-picture photographer, or
mechanic or scrub-woman or whoever it may
be that writes the scenarios.</p>

<p>We of this world are still, after many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thousand years of waiting, eager for the
faintest ray of light that may be thrown
on the actual conditions of what we call
“the world to come,” or as the Spiritists
love to say, “behind the veil,” but for the
tawdry imaginings of the Reverend Mr.
Owen the “Veil” serves only as an opaque
screen upon whose surface they flicker grotesquely
like the disorderly apparitions of
a cinema projection.</p>

<p>As a Seer this reverend gentleman, without
for a moment questioning his sincerity,
is a failure; his narrative, is childish in its
crudity and tedious as a dream told at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is interesting, and
that is to trace as we do, through the transcendental
claptrap of “rainbow brides”
and white-winged angels and the pseudo-scientific
jargon of “planes,” “vibrations,”
“spheres,” and “fourth dimension,” the—shall
I say humanizing—influence of the

bath tubs in the Heavenly Mansions—Bathtubs!
With hot and cold water, and Dr.
Owen does not stop at bathtubs; he assures
us there are also—don’t faint—<i>water
nymphs</i>! Can’t you see all Israel clamoring
for the picture rights!</p>

a school of water nymphs!</p>

<p>“<i>As we knelt the whole summit of the hill
seemed to become transparent—we saw
right through it and a part of the regions
below was brought out with distinctness.

against a rock, was a man of large
stature.</i>”</p>

Vale Owen is, like myself (to my shame
confess it), a motion-picture fan!</p>

<h2 id="ANOTHER_LOST_ART">ANOTHER LOST ART</h2>

<p class="dropcap">These are mournful days for the Polite
Arts. One by one they are passing
away—the Art of Conversation, the Art
of Paying Calls, the Art of Letter Writing.</p>

<p>The Art of Conversation is no longer
even a subject for conversation. No one
so much as remembers of what it died. Did
it languish and fade away into an Eternal
Pause as such a dignified gentleman of
the old school as the Art of Conversation
would be expected to do—or was it murdered?</p>

<p>The mystery surrounding the death of
the Art of Conversation has never been
properly cleared up. Some think it died of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
heart failure induced by the killing modern
pace. Others say it starved to death. Others
again, that it was done to death by
the chewing-gum trust. For my part, I
believe the Art of Conversation talked itself
to death. It died of obesity—it grew and
grew and grew until, when all the world
talked there was nobody left to listen. Then
it burst.</p>

<p>No such mystery hangs about the death
of the Art of Paying Calls. Here it was
a case of plain every-day murder—and
what is more, the murderer still lives. Millions
of electric volts are pumped into him
every day, but he still lives—the more electricity
we give him the livelier he grows.
He is the Telephone, and the Telephone is
the murderer of the Art of Calling.</p>

<p>Poor old Art of Calling! We shake our
heads and murmur perfunctory regrets—“good
old chap,” and all that sort of thing,
but really in our heart of hearts, let me whisper
it very low—we don’t really miss him
very much; to tell the truth, we are rather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that is to say, <i>quite</i> glad he is dead. If
anyone of us had had the courage of his
conviction he would have killed him long
ago. To speak plainly, the Art of Calling
was a pestiferous tyrant—and he only got
what he deserved.</p>

<h2 id="MR_CHESTERTON_AND_THE">MR. CHESTERTON AND THE
SOLILOQUY</h2>

<p class="dropcap">“I often talk to myself,” says Mr. G.
K. Chesterton, speaking in defense of
the stage soliloquy. “If a man does not talk
to himself it is because he is not worth talking
to.”</p>

<p>The deduction is obvious, but it is based
upon false premises. If Mr. Chesterton is
worth talking to, it is certainly not because
he talks to himself. It is impossible to
imagine a more foolish waste of energy than
that expended in talking to one’s self. The
man who talks to himself is twice damned
(as a fool). First, for wasting speech on
an auditor who knows in advance every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
word he will utter. Second, for listening to
a speaker whose every word he can foretell
before it is uttered.</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton’s argument, failing as it
does to prove that he is worth talking to,
is still less happy as a defense of the stage
soliloquy.</p>

<p>A character in a play talks to himself not,
as Mr. Chesterton would have us believe,
because he is worth talking to, but to enlighten
the audience on points which the inexpert
playwright has otherwise failed to
make plain.</p>

<p>The stage soliloquy is only permissible as
an indication of the character of one who
talks to himself in real life. For instance,
if I wished to dramatize G. K. Chesterton,
since he often talks to himself, I should have
him soliloquize upon the stage. I might
make it a double part with two Mr. Chestertons
dressed as the two Dromios. As a
stage device the soliloquy is only a confession
of weakness on the part of the playwright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and has been justly sentenced to
death.</p>

<p>Its only hope for a reprieve is to retain
(at great expense) an ex-president or an
eminent K. C. who might argue that since
the “fourth wall” of a stage interior is
removed in order that the audience may
view the actions of the players, it is therefore
permissible to remove the “fourth wall”
of the players’ heads so that the audience
may view the action of their brains.</p>

<p>And the ex-president or the eminent K.
C. would probably “get away with it.”</p>

<h2 id="BUNK">BUNK</h2>

<p class="dropcap">When Alexander the Great cut with
his sword the Gordian Knot, which
had baffled all his efforts to untie with
honest fingers, it goes without saying that
his impudent performance received the applause
of the onlookers.</p>

<p>As he stood there, his heavy sword still
swaying from the impetus of the stroke and
exclaimed with a challenging glare at those
before him (and belike an apprehensive
glance over his shoulder), “Did I or did I
not untie that knot?”—whatever might—nay,
must have been the unspoken comment
that passed from eye to eye, the answer
shouted in unison, was without a shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a doubt the Phrygian equivalent of “You
sure did!”</p>

<p>For the Great God Bunk (whose worshipers
are born at the rate of one a minute)
is as old as the world itself; and since we
have it on good authority that the world is
a stage, even though we do not suspect him
of a hand in its making, we know the old
rogue assisted at the first dress rehearsal
famous for all time for the smallness of the
cast and the inexpensiveness of the costuming.</p>

<p>King Gordius, whose genius contrived the
unpickable knot, is now comfortably forgotten,
while Alexander who destroyed what he
could not understand, still enjoys uneasy
immortality; for what is immortality at best
but the suspended sentence of Oblivion?</p>

<p>And the knot? The hempen hieroglyph
that was never solved. When oblivion has
overtaken Alexander and even the name of
Gordius is forgotten, the world, which is
surprisingly young for its age, will still babble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wonderingly of the knot that never was
and never will be untied.</p>

<p>Another high priest of the Great God
Bunk was Christopher Columbus, and on
how frail a foundation rests his immortal
fame—nothing more than the fragile, calcareous
container, (and fractured at that)
of an unborn domestic fowl.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the fame of Columbus
rests upon his impudent pretense of balancing
an egg by crushing it violently upon the
table. To be sure, Columbus also discovered
America, but in that he was only one of
a multitude. At that moment in the world’s
history the discovering of America was, like
golf, something between a sport and an obsession,
everybody was discovering America.
So common was it, that only a few of the discoverers
are remembered by name, and had
it not been for his famous egg-balancing
fraud the name of Christopher Columbus
would surely be among the forgotten ones.</p>

<p>To balance an egg on its apex—though
not impossible, is a tedious and dispiriting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
task; and even if Columbus had accomplished
it honestly without fracturing the
shell, so far from adding to his laurels he
might have lost them altogether. Queen
Isabella would never have had the patience
to sit through so long and boresome a performance,
and when the Queen leaves, you
know the performance is over.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is quite thinkable that it was
the dread of just such an ending to his audience
and the resultant stage fright reacting
upon an excitable sea-faring nature that
caused Columbus to break the egg.</p>

<p>The question now asks itself: Has Christopher
Columbus, posing as a clever impostor
when in reality only a stage-frightened
bungler, obtained his fame under false pretenses?
In unmasking his clandestine honesty
do we but prove him the greater fraud?
Bunk only knows!</p>

<p>Queen Dido of Carthage, on the other
hand, came by her dishonesty quite honestly—she
inherited it from her royal father’s
sister Jezebel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Jezebel, the patron sinner of half a
world of womankind, was Queen Dido’s
aunt. Good or bad, what was her Aunt
Jezebel’s was also Dido’s by right of inheritance.
And none of all the prophets of
the Great God Bunk was greater than this
prophetess.</p>

<p>Did she not for certain moneys receive
the title to so much land as might be compassed
by the bigness of a bull’s hide.</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<p>Did she not then carve said bull’s hide into
fine strips and therewith enclose enough real
estate for the foundation of the city of
Carthage?</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<h2 id="THE_COST_OF_A_PYRAMID">THE COST OF A PYRAMID</h2>

<p class="dropcap">If you were suddenly asked, by way of a
mental test, what particular thing or person
was most closely associated in your mind
with the word <i>strong</i>, you would probably
say a giant or an ox unless you had been
listening to a sermon whose text was the
sixteenth chapter of Judges, thirtieth verse,
in which case you would be more likely to
say Samson, but the typical example of
physical strength, would hardly be an Onion.</p>

<p>And yet the Onion, although, like the
proverbial Prophet, it may be without honor
among its fellow vegetables, is regarded by
at least one human outsider as the giant and
ox and Samson combined of the vegetable
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever your gastronomic leanings may
be, let you not be tempted to think lightly
of the Onion.</p>

<p>Though its name be unhallowed when it
appears in vulgar consort with Tripe, and its
reek abhorrent in the habitations of the
lowly, though it be viewed with contempt as
a poor relation by its kinsman the lily, the
Onion has a glorious past; it has a record
of achievement that is second to none; it
was, as I shall presently show, chiefly due to
the strength of Onions that at least one of
the great Egyptian Pyramids owed its existence.
Even Samson might envy the record
of the Onion!</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>When I tell you that the Pyramids of
Egypt, at any rate one of them, was built
by sheer vegetable strength, you may not
believe me, but perhaps you may believe the
historian Herodotus.</p>

<p>Herodotus found engraved on one of
the Pyramids a complete record of the exact
number of onions, radishes and leeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
supplied and consumed by the workmen who
piled its monstrous stones one upon the
other.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>And how were the Pyramids erected?
By some forgotten mechanical farce? No.</p>

<p>According to the late Cope Whitehouse,
Engineer and Egyptologist, the Pyramids
were built from the apex downward over the
conical hills that abound in the locality, the
interior of the hill being afterwards dug
away to form chambers and galleries. All
of which was accomplished by the unaided
physical power of human muscles and
sinews.</p>

<p>And whence came this power?</p>

<p>It was derived mainly from the vegetable
energy of Onions, leeks and radishes transmuted
by the chemistry of digestion and assimilation
to the muscles and sinews of the
slaves employed in building the Pyramid.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Herodotus tells us that with
the engraved record of the onions, leeks and
radishes consumed by the slaves, was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the computation of their cost which
amounted to 1,600 talents of silver, this being
the total cost of the vegetable fuel for
operating the human machinery employed
in the construction of the Pyramid.</p>

<p>And now let me ask you—what it is, this
thing we call Scent, this mysterious emanation
which is the Love Message of the Rose,
the Call of the Sea, the Strength of the Onion?</p>

<p>You don’t know? Neither do I, no more
does anybody.</p>

<p>Of all the five recording faculties which
we human creatures share with other animals,
the sense of Smell is the most elusive,
the most penetrating. It apprises us of
impending peril when all our other wires of
sensation are “busy” or “out of order” and
incapable of giving us warning. It has the
mysterious power of reproducing through
the “flash back” we call memory the forgotten
records of all of the other four sense-films,
and yet the scientists who can tell
us all about light waves and sound waves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and even make pictures of them, have very
little to say about the movement of the invisible
bodies whose impact upon our consciousness
produces the sensation of smell.</p>

<p>The terrific scent-energy hurled forth
from the seemingly inexhaustible storage
battery of an Onion or a Tuberose is more of
a mystery to our men of science than is the
composition of the crooked light waves from
the planet Mars or the height of the flames
of the Corona, measured in a solar eclipse.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Einstein, to whom the movements
of the heavenly bodies are as simple as
is a game of baseball to the average intellect,
cannot tell us whether the scent-atoms hurled
from the Onion rush forth in an impeccable
tangent or are pitched in a hyperbolic curve.</p>

<h2 id="WALTZING_MICE_AND_DANCING">WALTZING MICE AND DANCING
MEN</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“On some men the Gods bestow Fortitude,</div>
<div class="verse">On others a disposition for Dancing.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Thus the poet Hesiod, three thousand
years ago, scored with vitriolic antithesis
the Dancing man of his day⸺</p>

<p>And of all the days, for like the poor (and
no less deplorable) the Dancing man is always
with us.</p>

<p>The gods had much to answer for in the
days of Hesiod, and man had much to put
up with. Anything, good or evil, that befell
him, from the measles to melancholia—from
fortitude to dancing—was a gift of the gods,
wished on him as a token of their high esteem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
or otherwise. All man had to do was to
accept the gift, and, if it chanced to be boils,
as in the case of Job, he might be thankful
it was nothing worse.</p>

<p>Today we view a gift of the gods with distrust.
Before giving thanks we inspect it
in the light of Science. We examine it (as
a gift horse) in the mouth. If it is a good
gift, such as patience, or an aptitude for
cooking, we nurture and encourage it; if it
is an undesirable gift, like the measles, we
eradicate it, or give it to someone else as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, Hesiod uttered a
scientific truth.</p>

<p>That Fortitude and a Disposition to
Dance are gifts of the gods is just as true
physiologically as it is poetically speaking.</p>

<p>The Dancing man dances, the man of
Fortitude faces a cannon—or a musical comedy—because
he is built that way. In other
words, his behavior is due to certain pathological
structural conditions which are inherited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The behavior of the man of Fortitude is
due to the poverty of cerebral tissue in that
part of the brain whose function it is to
stimulate the activity known as imagination.
That is to say, he faces the cannon without
the least concern, because he can not imagine
what it will be like to have a cannon explode
right in his face.</p>

<p>What then are the pathological conditions
in the brain of the Dancing man that cause
him to dance? Unfortunately for the cause
of Science, the brain of the true Dancing
man is almost as rare a commodity as Radium.
In the United States alone there
is scarcely more than a fraction of an ounce
of this elusive gray tissue. To procure
even the minute quantity necessary for
experimental purposes would require the
sacrifice of thousands of Dancing men.
This in these days of Antivivisection Hysteria,
is out of the question.</p>

<p>Luckily for Science, there exists in the
animal Kingdom another creature afflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with the same peculiar tendency to perpetual
rotation as the Dancing man.</p>

<p>It is but one alliterative step from the
Dancing man to the Dancing mouse.</p>

<p>The restlessness and almost incessant
movement in circles and the peculiar excitability
of the Dancing mouse is attributed
by Rawitz, the famous physiologist, to the
<i>lack of certain senses which compels the
animal to strive through varied movements
to use to the greatest advantage those senses
which it does possess</i>.</p>

<p>Comparative physiologists have discovered
that the ability of animals to regulate
the position of the body with respect to
external objects is dependent in a large
measure upon the groups of sense organs
which collectively are called the ear.</p>

<p>To quote Rawitz again:</p>

<p><i>The waltzing mouse has only one normal
canal and that is the anterior vertical. The
horizontal and posterior vertical canals are
crippled and frequently they are grown together.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Panse, on the other hand, expresses his
belief that there are unusual structural conditions
in the brain, perhaps in the cerebellum,
to which are due the dance movements.</p>

<p>When the doctors disagree what are we
going to do about it?</p>

<p>For my part I am willing to leave it to
Cicero—</p>

<p>“<i>Nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit.</i>”</p>

<h2 id="THE_HOBGOBLIN">THE HOBGOBLIN</h2>

<p class="dropcap">There is a Hobgoblin that stalks in
the path of the athletic young writers
of the day and frightens them almost out of
their wits.</p>

<p>The Hobgoblin is the third person singular,
past tense, of the verb “Say,” and his
name is <span class="smcapuc">SAID</span>.</p>

<p>The Hobgoblin <span class="smcapuc">SAID</span> does not stalk alone;
with him stalk his sisters and his cousins and
his aunts, indeed, all the <span class="smcapuc">SAID</span> family except
old Gran’ma <span class="smcapuc">QUOTH</span>. Old Gran’ma <span class="smcapuc">QUOTH</span>,
who is much too old to stalk, stays at home
and dreams of the good old days when she
was a verb of fashion, honored and courted
by all the greatest writers of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>And when her grandchildren come home
in the evening and tell how they frightened
the athletic young writers almost out of their
wits, she nearly bursts her old-fashioned
stays, laughing at the drollery of it.
“Egad!” she cries. “An’ I were an hundred
years younger, I’d like nought better
than to take a hand myself, and lay my stick
about their backs, the young whippersnappers!”</p>

<p>And I for one, would like to see her do it.</p>

<p>How the <span class="smcapuc">SAID</span> family ever became professional
Hobgoblins, I can not say. All I
know is that, once a hardworking and highly
respected family, suddenly they found themselves
shunned. There was nothing left for
them but to become <span class="smcapuc">HOBGOBLINS</span>. Now their
only pleasure in life is to see what funny
antics they can make the athletic young
writers perform in trying to escape from
them.</p>

<p>And funny they certainly are.</p>

<p>Here are a few specimens from some of
our leading “best sellers”:</p>

wildly.</p>

<p>“What are your terms?” he <i>clucked</i>.</p>

you can make almost as funny ones at home?

<p class="dropcap">On the first of May I took a day off and
used the telephone. It is best to take a
day off if you want to get a number these
times, and the number asked for was Spring
one, nine, two, two—yes, Spring, Nineteen
Twenty-Two. “There’s no such number,”
said Central; “what you want is Winter
1921.” I assured her that was the last number
in the world I desired, and after a wait
of an hour or so she gave me Blizzard 1888
on a busy wire, comparing notes with Winter
1920, and I began to despair of ever getting
my number.</p>

<p>I rang off and waited. I am a patient
person, I waited a whole hour to allow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
wire to cool off. Then I called again and
this time I was rewarded by hearing at the
other end of the wire a faint far-off, fuzzy,
mewing sound.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the Pussy-Willow!</p>

<p>It was Lawrence Sterne, wasn’t it? who
wrote, “God tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb,” and it is quite a happy thought that
the gentle airs that succeed the blustering
winds of March, are a Providential concession
to the tender nurslings of the April
fields.</p>

<p>But the Pussy-Willow comes in February
and early March and it would be asking
too much to expect Providence to temper
the wholesome and necessary rigors of these
months for the sake of the venturesome kittens
of the Willow bough.</p>

<p>Who but Providence (or Mr. Hoover)
could ever have thought of the happy expedient
of providing each and every Pussy-Willow,
not only in the United States but
also in England, France, Belgium and even
Germany, with a warm fur overcoat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>And I verily believe that if the Pussy-Willows
were lodged on the cold wet ground
instead of perched on the high and dry
branches, Providence (or Mr. Hoover)
would have seen to it that in addition to
fur coats they were provided with galoshes.</p>

<h2 id="PERNICIOUS_PEACHES">PERNICIOUS PEACHES</h2>

<p class="dropcap">The Pernicious Peaches whereof we
speak are never out of season. They
may be seen almost any month of the year
on the covers of magazines, devoted to the
moral and social uplift of young girls in general,
and the American young girl in particular.</p>

<p>The February magazine peach crop is
usually most abundant—All through the
merry month of Saint Valentine they hang
on the news-stands, singly or in clusters, and
Peaches they are to be sure—Peaches in
the stupidest, cheapest, slangiest nonsense
of the word.</p>

<p>There they hang to quote the redundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Dr. Roget, F. R. S.—“<i>simpering, smirking,
sniggling, giggling, ogling, tittering, prinking,
preening, flaunting, flirting, mincing,
coquetting, frivoling, attitudinizing, self-conscious
artificial, smug, namby-pamby,
sentimental, unnatural, stagy, shallow,
weak, wanting, soft, sappy, spoony, fatuous,
idiotic, imbecile, driveling, blatant, babbling,
vacant, foolish, silly, senseless, addle-pated,
giddy, childish, chuckle-headed, puerile</i>,”
and, what is above all else inexcusable in a
peach—mushy.</p>

<p>And these (in journals that set the fashions
moral, mental, social and sartorial) for
our young American sister at the most impressionable
age of her life—the age when,
whatever may be her dormant possibilities,
she is by her nature irresistibly impelled to
pattern herself after the favorite girl of her
class in school, or the favorite actress on
the stage—to copy her coiffure, her dress,
her deportment, even the expression of her
face.</p>

<p>And how, you ask, can a young girl be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
harmed by imitating what, however vacuous
or silly, is after all only an expression?</p>

<p>The answer is, that just as a persistent
bend of thought modifies and in time fixes
the expression of the face, so a habitual expression
(or lack of expression) of face influences
the bend of thought and, in time,
fixes the character.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe this, dear girl, stand
before your looking-glass and smirk at yourself
as hard as you can, until you look (as
much as it is possible for a human girl to
look) like a magazine-cover Peach. Then
try to hold the “Peach” look while you recite:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>The stars of midnight shall be dear</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>To her; and she shall lean her ear</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>In many a secret place</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Where rivulets dance their wayward round</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And beauty born of murmuring sound</i></div>
<div class="verse indent2"><i>Shall pass into her face.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You see it’s impossible! You can’t do it,
any more than you can stroke your head up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and down at the same time as you stroke
your chest sideways. Your mouth has come
out of curl—the foolish light has gone out of
your eyes. Perhaps (if you really feel what
you were reciting) you look just the least
bit solemn. If so, try to hold the solemn
look while you recite the following by a
popular song writer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Call me pet names dearest—</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Call me a bird</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That flies to my breast</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>At one cherishing word,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That folds its wild wings there</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ne’er dreaming of flight,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>That tenderly sings there in loving delight.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Oh my sad heart keeps pining</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>For one fond word,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Call me pet names dearest,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Call me a bird!</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By the time you have finished, your solemn
reflection in the glass will have changed to
something almost as idiotic as the “peach”
on the magazine cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Without question, the vulgar standards of
expression these simpering sirens are setting
for the impressionable young girl of today
will degrade her just as surely as the wholesome,
high-bred type of womanhood evolved
by Charles Dana Gibson improved and developed
all that was best in her sister of
twenty years ago.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>The theory that nature imitates art is
much older than Oscar Wilde, who (owing
to the carelessness of Mr. Whistler) is supposed
to have originated it.</p>

<p>It is so old that Mr. G. K. Chesterton any
moment may rise to dispute it, and announce
to an astonished London that it is Art that
imitates Nature; nevertheless, Nature <i>does</i>
imitate Art.</p>

<p>Is it possible that there is method in all
this magazine madness? Is it possible that
these magazines being devoted (among
other devotions) to ladies’ attire, fear that
too great an improvement in the female of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
our species would divert her thoughts from
the imbecilities of dress to higher—and less
profitable—things?</p>

<h2 id="SECOND_CHILDHOODS_HAPPY">SECOND CHILDHOOD’S HAPPY
HOUR</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I sometimes ask myself (when there
is no one else to pester) whether the
present tendency toward Primitivism, in
Art, Religion, Government, Conduct and
Costume (everything in fact) may not be a
sign that the world is coming, if not already
come, to its second childhood, and I invariably
answer myself in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Second Childhood, as of course you know,
is the “happy hour” of an old age whose
faculties have diminished to the exact degree
that marks the undeveloped mental and
physical attributes of infancy.</p>

<p>Take any baby—not your own, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reader, yours is an exception I know, but
any common ordinary baby—and I think
when you have examined it you will agree
with me that, judged by ultra-modern standards
of culture, it is the most decadent being
on earth.</p>

<p>To begin with, the baby’s sociological
viewpoint is a mixture of passionate pessimism
and pure unmitigated Anarchism.</p>

<p>Its musical output is a hysterical cacophony
with all the exasperating disregard of
consonance and key characteristic of the up-to-date
composition.</p>

<p>Its Plastic and Graphic Art (achieved
through the accident of the inverted Porridge
bowl or the overturned inkwell) is
the Post-Impressionism of Matisse and Picasso,
whose law is the Law of Moses—“Thou
shalt not make unto thee any graven
image, or any likeness of any thing that is
in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the
earth.”</p>

<p>The Literary Message of the baby is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
combination of the styles of Gertrude Stein,
Carl Sandberg and an unassisted Ouija
board and is only to be interpreted through
the medium of maternal intuition.</p>

<p>And as for the Art Sartorial, are not the
fashions feminine venturing each successive
season a little nearer to that of the newborn
babe?</p>

<p>“Well,” says I to myself, “supposing we
admit that Modern Culture and Infancy
are identical in expression, and that the
World is entering upon its second childhood;
what does it mean⸺ Is it the end of
all things or only a fresh start?”</p>

<p>There you have me! I reply. There are
some questions that even I cannot answer.
I give it up.</p>

<p>If, as Dr. Einstein asserts, our planet has
been receiving crooked light-rays all this
time, it is a very serious matter and there
is no knowing <i>what</i> may come of it; certainly
the Cosmic Light Company ought to be investigated.
But don’t be down-hearted,
dear Reader, some day the Einstein Amendment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the Law of Gravitation may be repealed,
and made retroactive into the bargain;
it is all a matter of Relativity and it
may turn out that the Relativity-shoe is on
the other foot and that it is the Earth’s orbit
that is on the blink and not the light rays
at all.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. G. B. Shaw will enlighten us—as
a projector of crooked light-rays, he
ought to know something about it.</p>

<h2 id="PITY_THE_POOR_GUEST_OF">PITY THE POOR GUEST OF
HONOR</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Once when marooned on a small island
in the midst of a turbulent sea of traffic,
latitude Fifth Avenue, longitude Forty-second
Street, I asked the governor of the
island, a man of great stature and kingly
mien, what he thought was the origin of
the institution known as the Complimentary
Banquet. Checking with an imperious gesture
a monstrous traffic wave that seemed
like to engulf us both the next moment, his
voice came to me calm and reassuring above
the tumult that surged and roared about us.
“If it’s a wake you do be meaning, sorr, sure
it’s as old as Ireland itself, it is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>And the Traffic Cop was right.</p>

<p>Nearly two thousand years ago Strabo,
the Greek geographer, describing the natives
of Ivernia, wrote: “They are more savage
than the English, and enormous eaters,
deeming it commendable to devour their deceased
relatives.”</p>

<p>In this, probably the first reference in literature
to the Irish wake, the suggestion
that the departed one contributed anything
more than the honor of his company must be
taken with a grain of salt. Strabo was an
awful liar, and whole barrels of salt might
be used on his “Geography” without perceptibly
affecting its flavor. In all probability
the cannibal touch was nothing more
than an unseemly concession to the yellow
taste of the Attic metropolis.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though he never appeared
on the menu, the “departed relative,” the
<i>sine qua non</i> of all festive gatherings, was
(as the social instinct developed among the
savage tribes) ever in increasing demand,
and it is to be feared that in smart Ivernian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
circles it was not unusual to speed the departing
relative in promoting the gaiety of
an otherwise dull season.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it is hardly to be
wondered at that in Ivernia, at that period,
personal popularity was the most unpopular
thing imaginable, and what more thinkable
than that the reluctant candidate for a complimentary
dinner should feign for the occasion
the grewsome condition necessary for
qualification.</p>

<p>With the spread of Christianity, this irksome
feat of mimicry on the part of the
Guest of Honor, at first a protective subterfuge,
grew to be a social convention. And
irksome indeed it was.</p>

<p>To feign at a banquet by the exercise of
self-control a state of unconsciousness, joyfully
achieved by one’s fellow guests through
more convivial channels, was no task for the
amateur. Then it was that, puffed up, comatose,
obese, along came the Professional
Diner Out. And now, after nearly two
thousand years, what have we to show?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Could the savage rite, described by
Strabo, depressing as it must have been,
by any possibility be as gloomy as the Testimonial
Banquet of today? Is the Guest of
Honor, sitting at the High Table feigning
unconsciousness, the miserable target for
asphyxiating bombs of wit, of anecdote, and
of reminiscence—is he any less to be pitied
than the deceased relative of the Ivernian
dinner? Yet we call ourselves civilized; we
think it barbaric to hang a fellow being for
anything short of murder. Why have we
not equal consideration for the innocent
Guest of Honor? Why do we not dine him
in effigy?</p>

<p>Few of us have forgotten the outrage of
1912 when William Dean Howells was
dragged from his comfortable fireside by
Col. Harvey, then the editor of Harper’s
Magazine, who deaf to his cries and entreaties,
dined, wined and flashlighted in the
presence of a frenzied mob armed to the
teeth with knives, and forks and spoons.</p>

<p>How much more humane to have dined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Mr. Howells in effigy! A waxen image
simulating as far as possible the kindly features
of the Great Novelist, sitting in the
place of honor, bowing, even smiling by
means of some ingenious mechanism! This,
with a phonograph record of the graceful
speech of acknowledgment, and the ravening
public would have gone home happy
and none the wiser. Thus with the dawn
of a new era of Humanity, one more chapter
of the ponderous book of martyrs would
be closed forever.</p>

<h2 id="A_NEW_MONROE_DOCTRINE">A NEW MONROE DOCTRINE</h2>

<p class="dropcap">When Old Doctor Monroe discovered
and patented his famous anti-monarchical
specific, warranted to prevent
the spread of Effete Despotism, Imperialitis
and Throne Trouble, why didn’t he invent
some equally Reliable Nostrum to
check the epidemic of Old World names that
was spreading like a blight of infantile
paralysis among the thousands of husky
young cities then springing up all over the
United States? Rome, Syracuse, Troy,
Thebes, Memphis, Ithaca, and a host of
others, names dark and ill ominous to
chubby young cities with no evil traditions
to live down to, staining their bright banners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with bloody blots and black bars of
sinister tradition where should only be the
golden stars and crimson bars of freedom.</p>

<p>Indian names such as Oshkosh and Kankakee
were to be had ready-made for the
asking; but they were few and for the most
part too grotesque and Asiatic sounding for
the liking of a serious-minded young republic
just starting out in the city-raising business.</p>

<p>But it is no easy task to find new names
for cities, above all names that are euphonious,
and the last place one would expect to
find them is the Medical Dictionary. The
names of diseases? And why should that
deter us? If a Rose by any other name will
smell as sweet, surely a Rose with any other
smell will at least look and sound as pretty.
Good Doctor Watts (or was it Mr. Wesley?)<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
when adapting tunes for his new
hymn-book answered his critics by exclaiming,
“Why should the devil have all the best
tunes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Why, indeed! And by the same token,
why should the Diseases have all the prettiest
sounding names?</p>

<p>Try one on your city and see if you don’t
like it.</p>

<p>Has not Dyspepsia, Maine, an austere
dignity about it that no old-world city name
could possibly confer?</p>

<p>Neurasthenia, Kansas, on the other hand,
brings up visions of shady sidewalks, pleasant
gardens, and glimpses through slender
trees, of a sun-kissed river. If your doctor
should prescribe for you mountain air and
outdoor exercise would you not instantly
buy a ticket to Colic, Vermont? What more
catchy name than Measles, Illinois, or Diphtheria,
Wisconsin? Stripped of medical association
there is scarcely a name in all the
<i>materia medica</i> that is wholly lacking in
euphonistic charm.</p>

<p>Why not bring the matter before a Special
Session of Congress? Anything is better
than Persepolis and Pekin—even Tonsilitis,
Missouri.</p>

<h2 id="DO_CATS_COME_BACK">DO CATS COME BACK?</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Certain it is that Cats are disappearing;
that is to say the common friendly
Tabbies and Tommies of the town we used to
see doing their morning marketing in the
ash cans, or with whom we were wont to pass
the time of day in the neighboring door-yards.</p>

<p>In the last week I have seen only two
street cats and only one to speak to, and
that one was a stray orphan kitten who had
been adopted by a kind-hearted bookbinder;
the other when I would have accosted her
gave me one strange look and vanished.</p>

<p>I glanced hurriedly down at my shoes as
my hands flew instinctively to my necktie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and hat, but the foot-gear were mates (of
long standing) and the hat and tie were each
in its proper place; nothing was there about
my attire to shock the sensibilities of the
most fastidious feline!</p>

<p>What did it mean? No cat had ever
treated me with such discourtesy before.
Then it was that I bethought me of how
few of the feline brotherhood or sisterhood I
had seen abroad of late.</p>

<p>Have they been carried off by an epidemic?
Do cats catch influenza? or catalepsy?
Has the scrap-market been affected
by the high cost of living? Has the percentage
of nutriment in the garbage can diminished
to the vanishing point? Have the
mice struck for shorter hours?</p>

<p>As I pondered thus at the corner of a
lowly street, there tripped past my line of
vision a fur coat whose opulence and sheen
made its background of untidy brick and
stone seem doubly dull and dingy. The
motive power of this unlikely pelt was (as
far as could be seen) lisle thread and oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ties but I made no further note of the girl;
my mind was fixed on the coat—it was the
third of its kind I had observed in as many
minutes in that mean street.</p>

<p>A shiver ran through me; I had seen a
ghost, a procession of ghosts. It was as if
a ouija board had suddenly screamed miaou!</p>

<p>And they say cats come back.</p>

<h2 id="THE_RUTHLESSNESS_OF_MR">THE RUTHLESSNESS OF MR.
COBB</h2>

<p class="dropcap">One by one the idols of tradition go by
the board. William Tell’s Apple and
Paul Revere’s Ride were long ago cast into
the trash-basket of Fiction; even Joan of
Arc has been received into the mythology
of Sainthood, and now that hero of our
happy childhood, Casablanca, the boy who
stood on the burning deck, is about to be
snatched from us by that reckless iconoclast,
Mr. Irvin Cobb.</p>

<p>Like the ruthless Woodman in the poem,
Mr. Cobb has struck his axe into the very
roots of this revered tree of our childish belief⸺</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Cobb, the Casabianca-tree
is only a nut tree and a horsechestnut tree at
that. Writing in the <i>Saturday Evening
Post</i>, he tells us that Casabianca was nothing
more than a “feeble-minded leatherhead.”
If that be so then Barbara Frietchie
was a leatherhead, and Edith Cavell, and all
the host of those who gave up or were ready
to give up their lives for that purely imaginary
thing, an ideal, and what <i>could</i> the
blessed Evangelist have been thinking of
when he wrote “<i>He that hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal.</i>” John
12:25.</p>

<p>Exactly two thousand years ago when the
city of Pompeii was destroyed by an eruption
of Mount Vesuvius, a Roman sentinel,
another idol of tradition just such a leatherhead
as Casablanca, refused to desert his
post and was burned to death for the very
foolish reason that he was “on duty.” He
is there to this day, standing “at attention,”
in the shape of a cast made from the matrix
of molten lava that enveloped his living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
body and you may call him a leatherhead
if you like, but the memory of his
leatherheadedness will endure when sensible
people like you, dear reader, and me
and Mr. Cobb are forgotten.</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>Nevertheless there are two sides to every
question, and it is quite possible that Casabianca
may have been a perfectly sensible
lad, whose only thought was to disobey his
captain and desert his post, but the tar melting
from the heat in the seams of the deck,
and adhering to his feet caused him to stick
to the ship. Be that as it may, <i>I</i> shall stick
to Casabianca!</p>

Finchsifter stands barely four feet six in his
stockings, by all the laws of natural selection
the human embodiment of his Brobdingnagian
simile, must be either Mrs. Finchsifter
or some not impossible Eve of a Finchsifter
dream Paradise. A colossal counterpart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
(I picture her), of the waxen Demi-Goddess
in the Finchsifter show window
displaying with revolving impartiality on a
faultless neck and bosom the glittering
treasures of India, Africa, Peru, Mexico
and Maiden Lane.</p>

<p>To be strictly truthful, I do not know
that Mr. Finchsifter’s show window can
boast such a waxen deity as I have described;
indeed for all I know he possesses neither a
show window nor the merchandise to advertise
in such a window, but I have as the saying
is, a “hunch” that Mr. Finchsifter’s
imagery as applied to my Lake is based on
something more than a mere academic interest
in the adornment, textile or lapidarious
of the human form.</p>

<p>And my Lake—in the first place it is not
my Lake (but of that later), neither does
it resemble a sapphire any more than the
Pines and Laurels on its bank (save that
when agitated they heave or flutter) resemble
a green plush corsage.</p>

<p>If I were asked for an image, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
compare my Lake to an India-rubber band
rather than to a sapphire. In form an elongated
ellipse, it possesses an elasticity of
circumference that is little short of miraculous.</p>

<p>The boastful pedestrian, glowing from
his early morning trot around its shore will
tell you it is a good ten miles.</p>

<p>The persistent swain, scheming to lure his
Heart’s Desire, high heeled and reluctant,
to the amorous shades of “Lover’s Landing,”
tells her, upon his honor, that it is
not more than a mile all the way round. To
be precise, the distance round my Lake is
something between a stroll and a “constitutional”—or
to put it relatively about what
the circumambulation of an ocean liner’s
deck would be to an athletic inch worm.</p>

<p>As I said before, my Lake is not my Lake.
It is nobody’s Lake. Not a human habitation
profanes its bosky shores. The only
beings that make even a pretense of ownership
are five starch-white swans that patrol
it from morning till night, turning fitfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
this way and that and probing its depths
and shallows with their yellow bills as if
seeking for the missing Deed of title. On
certain days when the diamond Lake is still,
and the Pine and Laurel corsage is untroubled
by a tremor, the starch-white company
is doubled by five ghostly “understudies”
who reflect their whiteness curve for
curve and feather for feather with a fidelity
of inversion that may find its match only in
the art of a Shaw or a Chesterton.</p>

<p>It was on such a day as this that I met
Mr. Finchsifter. I had completed the circuit
of the Lake and leaving the wooded
path that skirts its shore ascended through
the woods to the level ground above, where
on the further side of a well kept automobile
road rises the lofty iron grille that engirdles
for miles the country seat of Barabbas
Wolfe, the Sausage King, typifying at
once, by the safe deposit-like thickness of
its bars and the view-inviting openness of
its scrollwork, the innate love of show, tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
by newly acquired exclusiveness of a
lord not to the manor born.</p>

<p>Gazing, in beady eyed appraisal at the
neat but somewhat constricted Italian garden
to which the railing at this point invited
the eye—stood Finchsifter.</p>

<p>In this crowded jungle of spotless stone
Lions, tomblike seats and arches backed by
California privet and immature cypresses
there was an irreverent suggestion of the
Villa D’Este done into American slang.</p>

<p>He turned hearing my step, “Where is it
I have seen it—before?”</p>

<p>“In the movies perhaps”—I ventured.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Thank you very much!” he
exclaimed. “I knew I had seen it somewhere!”</p>

<p>After ascertaining my name in reluctant
payment for the unsolicited tender of his
own he continued, “but the Lions show better
in the ‘pictures’ don’t they? Why
didn’t they get them with moss already.”</p>

<p>“With moss?” I queried.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Finchsifter. “Didn’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
know such a stone Lion comes also with the
moss, the same as the genuine old antique
furniture comes with the real hand-made
worm-holes!”</p>

<p>I remembered guiltily how on the occasion
of my last visit to Lake towers when
asked by Mrs. Barabbas Wolfe, what I
thought of her marble Lions, I had exclaimed
with truthful enthusiasm “Wonderful!
But my dear lady <i>how</i> do you keep
them so clean?”</p>

<p>We walked on together, and though
avoiding as we did so the physical proximity
of my Lake we could not exclude it wholly
from our conversation.</p>

<p>It was a passing glitter of the water
caught through the pines below us at a turn
in the road that inspired the Diamond-plush
simile from which try as I may, I shall
never be able to dissociate the image of my
Lake.</p>

<p>Greatly to my surprise I found myself
becoming interested in Finchsifter, and during
the luncheon which followed our return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to my Bungalow and the dinner that evening
at his hotel, we laid what promised to
be the foundation of a lasting friendship.</p>

<p>To be sure he was a man of many words,
but the words of Finchsifter were well
trained words, old family servants that
knew their places and never presumed, or
took liberties with the listener.</p>

<p>If a reply or comment were imperative—an
adjective caught at random gave instant
clue to what had gone before—even as a
single toe joint restores to the naturalist
the forgotten form of the Iohippus.</p>

<p>Finchsifter was a mental rest cure, his
talk was soothing as a verbal brain massage.
I conceived that one might form the Finchsifter
habit, in time even become a slave to
it as men become slaves to cocaine, Psychoanalysis,
or Taxicabs.</p>

<p>But this was not to be.</p>

<p>As a would-be suicide has been turned
from his purpose by the chill of the water
into which he has plunged—so it was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Finchsifter himself that I was cured of the
Finchsifter habit.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of our second meeting,
appointed at the suggestion of Finchsifter
that we take our matutinal walk
around the Lake in each others company.</p>

<p>He greeted me with a delighted smile,
exclaiming as he took my hand in both of
his very new saffron gloves.</p>

<p>“I have a great idea found—!—You are
a poet? yes? Then you know all about this
Free Verse which I read always about in
the magazines? Perhaps you can yourself
make it? Yes?” His face fairly shone with
the inner flame of his project.</p>

<p>I found myself harkening against my
will. What possible interest could Finchsifter
have in verse of any kind—let alone
free verse. “This will never do,” I reflected.
“If he compels me to listen—then we shall
cease to be friends—I came here to rest.
I might as well take the first train back to
New York!” Finchsifter was still talking.
Eyeing me keenly as if mentally debating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
my trustworthiness—he continued: “If it is
sure enough Free, then it don’t cost nothing.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” I said,
recalled abruptly from my own thoughts.</p>

<p>“Free verse!” cried Finchsifter. “That’s
my scheme!—but don’t you tell it—It is
between only ourselves—fifty-fifty—we
split everything—<i>we</i> create the demand—we
corner the supply, you and me together
corner all the free verse in the United States—in
this world for that matter and sell it
for—” Again he hesitated—“If I might
ask it—about what does a Poet get for such
a little piece of poetry? The kind that is not
free. A piece so long I mean.”—He measured
a sonnet’s width of air between his
thumb and fore-finger—“what do you get
for that much?” I told him what the magazines
pay me.</p>

<p>“What! A dollar a line! Gott in Himmel!
we make a fortune! That’s what I tell
Rebecca—If we corner all the free verse in
the United States and sell it for no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as five cents a line—we make our fortune!
but a dollar a line!—Himmel!”—he fairly
danced for ecstasy and then it was I made
the discovery, by which I lost if not a Fortune
at least a Finchsifter.</p>

<p>I stood still as the tide of words with its
flotsam of tossing gestures, continued—I
heard nothing. I only waited for Finchsifter
to subside.</p>

<p>“Am I right!” He gasped at length with
what by every law of supply and demand
should have been his latest breath.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about”—I
replied angrily. “All I know is we’re
walking the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean the wrong way?”
said Finchsifter.</p>

<p>“The wrong way round the Lake that’s
what I mean!”</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>I don’t know how long we stood there
arguing the question, I only know that his
mind was inaccessible to reason, persuasion—even
bribery, for, as a last resort, I offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to give him a list of all the best free verse
writers in America if he would only listen
to reason—nothing would move him—Finchsifter
had always walked round the
lake from right to left and always would—and
what I said about his rubbing its
precious plush corsage the wrong way of the
nap was all rot.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel and left him. Half
an hour later when we met at Lover’s Landing
which is exactly half way round the Lake
we passed without speaking.</p>

<p>And now I must wait each day until
Finchsifter has taken his walk from right
to left round my Lake, taking my walk
(from left to right) in the chill of the evening
to pacify the tutelary Goddess by
smoothing back her green plush corsage,
which has been rubbed the wrong way by
Finchsifter.</p>

<h2 id="THE_HUNDREDTH">THE HUNDREDTH
AMENDMENT</h2>

<p class="dropcap">After the passage of the Ninety-eighth
Amendment making it a misdemeanor
to “<i>manufacture, sell, own, possess,
purchase, nurse, dandle or otherwise
caress or display that effigy of the infant
form commonly known as a Doll</i>” … the
abolition of that feathered symbol of vicarious
maternity, the Stork, followed as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>The passage of the Anti-Stork Bill or,
to be more accurate, the Ninety-ninth
Amendment, thanks to the tenacity and tact
of President John Quincy Epstein, was the
most expeditious piece of legislation put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
through by the hundred and fifth Congress.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, however, that
the introduction of lectures on obstetrics
into the curriculum of the kindergartens had
done much to educate the child vote and
that at the time the fate of the Stork was
hanging in the balance, that once esteemed
Bird of Prurient Evasion was already becoming
unpopular and well on its way to
join the Dodo.</p>

<p>And now the department of government
devoted to the cause of Infant Uplift, having
abolished the Mock-Offspring and settled
the fate of the Bird of Nativity, cast
about for some new Field of Endeavor.</p>

<p>And what more fitting than that they
should light upon that hoary old imposter
masquerading under the several aliases
Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle,
and Father Christmas?</p>

<p>At once the Propaganda was started.</p>

<p>Press agents were engaged, lecture tours
arranged, magazines subsidized.</p>

<p>No matter what it might cost, this “Vulture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gnawing at the Palladium of Infant
Emancipation” must be destroyed!!</p>

<p>Santa Claus, once, in the memory of living
men and women, adored by children and
winked at by their parents, was now branded
as an imposter, a mountebank, a public
nuisance, and a perverter of infant intelligence.</p>

<p>Santa Claus was an outlaw from the
Commonwealth of Reason.</p>

<p>It was “thumbs down” for Santa!</p>

<p>It may be well to explain right here
(since none of the events chronicled in this
History has yet happened) that the movement
for the Emancipation and Self-Determination
of Infants, which has now
taken such great strides, had its initiation
in the presidential term of Miles Standish
Sovietski when Congress extended the franchise
to every child over five years of age
who had made any serious contribution to
literature or higher mathematics.</p>

<p>It was in the same year that President
Sovietski signed the Sixty-fourth Amendment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to the Federal Constitution, prohibiting
the publication of fairy tales, and Congress
suspended the Limitation-of-Search
Act in order that private libraries and
nurseries might be raided without warning
and all copies of the forbidden works summarily
seized and destroyed.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the federal enactment,
the states of Washington, Illinois,
Nevada, and Oregon, ever in the advance
of any great intellectual movement, passed
laws prohibiting “<i>the personification or representation,
public or private, in theatre,
music hall, club house, lodge, church fair,
schoolhouse, or private residence, of any
supernatural, fairy, or otherwise mythical
person or persons or fraction thereof</i>.”</p>

<p>The passing of a Constitutional Amendment
was now an almost every-day occurrence.
Indeed, since the ratification of the
Forty-fourth Amendment prohibiting the
use of sarsaparilla as a beverage (coffee and
tea had been legislated out of existence five
years earlier) the enactment of a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Amendment excited little or no comment.
Even the Seventy-ninth Amendment forbidding
“<i>the use of caviar, club sandwiches,
and buttonhole bouquets, except for medicinal
purposes</i>,” received only casual notice
in the Metropolitan Dailies.</p>

<p>The twentieth century was rapidly nearing
its close and the political apathy that for
fifty years had been gradually benumbing
the Public morale now threatened to paralyze
completely what little still remained of
courage and initiative.</p>

<p>Even the latest work of Bernard Shaw,
“A Bird’s-Eye View of the Infinite,” published
(with a five volume preface) on Mr.
Shaw’s hundred and fortieth birthday,
aroused so little resentment that his projected
visit to the United States had to be
abandoned, in spite of the fact that “Bean
and Soup o’Bean,” written only a week
earlier, was acknowledged to have contributed
largely to the triumph of the Seventy-ninth
Amendment, making Vegetarianism
compulsory in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hundredth Amendment passed
quickly though the earlier stages of routine
and perfunctory debate without any appreciable
sign of anything approaching
popular protest.</p>

<p>Here and there a guarded expression
such as “Poor old Santa! I’m sorry he’s
got to go!” was voiced, in the privacy of a
club, by some elderly gentleman. Nothing
more.</p>

<p>Somewhere, behind Somebody, was a
Power that directed and guided—perhaps
threatened. Nobody knew who or what or
where it was or in what manner it worked,
but work it did and to such purposes that,
after a scant week of cut and dried speech-making
that deceived no one, the Amendment
was submitted unanimously by both
houses of Congress and the foregone conclusion
of ratification was all that remained
to make the abolition of Santa Claus an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>Then, inevitably as fish follows soup, followed
the ratification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hundredth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, prohibiting
Santa Claus, slipped through the ratification
process like an oil prospectus in a mail
chute. There was only one hitch, Rhode
Island, but since Rhode Island had refused
to ratify a single one of the last Seventy-nine
Amendments, her action was accepted
as part of the program and a proof of
unanimity.</p>

<p>So Santa Claus was abolished?</p>

<p>Not so fast please!—Who’s writing this
History anyway?</p>

<div class="dotbreak">. . . .</div>

<p>For the benefit of the clever reader who
may have guessed the word left out in the
last line of the above quatrain, I will explain
that the asterisks are used in obedience to a
clause of the Ninety-first Amendment prohibiting,
both in speech and print, the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of the word * * * * * which, as the political
emblem of the Free People’s Party (now
happily defunct), came into such contempt
that it was made a misdemeanor “<i>to print,
publish, own, sell, purchase, or consult any
book, pamphlet, catalogue, circular, or dictionary
containing the word * * * * *</i>” It
has been estimated that over eighty million
dollars’ worth of Century and Standard dictionaries
were destroyed in the first year of
this Amendment’s operation. The loss in
Nursery Rhymes, children’s books, and
Natural Histories is beyond computation.</p>

<p>But to return to the White House.</p>

<p>President John Quincy Epstein had retired
to his study on the second floor shortly
before midnight, taking with him the engrossed
copy of the Hundredth Amendment
which now only required his Spencerian
signature to expunge the name of
Santa Claus forever from the American
speech and language as utterly and irrevocably
as the forbidden word * * * * *.</p>

<p>The hours passed in a perfectly orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
manner, like school children at a fire drill—<i>one,
two, three, four</i>—without pushing or
jostling—<i>five, six, seven, eight</i>—(don’t you
think history is much more interesting in
the form of a simple “Outline” like this than
spun out in the common manner?)—<i>nine,
ten</i>—! At eleven o’clock the door of the
President’s study was burst open by the
order of the Vice President, Rebecca Crabtree,
now, by a sudden and mysterious
stroke of Fate, herself become the President
of the United States.</p>

<p>For John Quincy Epstein was dead.</p>

<p>How or just when he died will never be
known. Always a cold, forbidding (not to
say prohibiting) man, his body when found
was still cold—if anything colder; his watch
which should have marked the exact moment
of his demise, was ticking merrily, so the
exact moment will forever remain unrecorded.</p>

<p>But Santa Claus still lives and will live
forever!</p>

<p>On the massive gold-inlaid-with-ivory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
desk (a Christmas gift from the United
Department Stores of America), lay a
paper, inscribed, and signed in the President’s
handwriting, and sealed with his
official seal.</p>

<p>It was the presidential veto of the Hundredth
Amendment; and by virtue of a
clause in Amendment Thirty-three “<i>no
Constitutional Amendment vetoed by the
President shall ever be resubmitted to the
country nor any fraction thereof</i>—”</p>

<p>Santa Claus will live forever! Hurray
for Santa Claus!</p>

<h2 id="SAY_IT_WITH_ASTERISKS">SAY IT WITH ASTERISKS</h2>

<p class="dropcap">A vague and terrifying science, astronomy!
Only as a subdued though
highly decorative lighting effect can I regard
the stellar pageant with equanimity.</p>

<p>To be sure I have learned to locate the
Dipper and Orion and Cassiopeia’s Chair
and a few other popular favorites, but this
painful knowledge was acquired solely for
its conversational value on summer evenings
at week-end, house or yachting parties.</p>

<p>Beyond that, all I know about the science
of astronomy could be as accurately demonstrated
with the perforations of a colander,
held up to the light, as on the most perfect
star map in the Encyclopedia Britannica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
If the truth must be told, I much prefer
Asterisks.</p>

<div class="starbreak6">* * * * * *</div>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>With a moon and a mariner’s compass
and a good road map or chart, the traveler
by land or sea can get along very well without
the stars, but in the trackless mazes of
literature and art, how would the wandering
Philistine fare without Asterisks? An
anthology or guide of any kind without
Asterisks would be as unthinkable as a
Dalmatian dog without spots or a red-headed
boy without freckles.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself in the city of Berlin with
a de-stellated Baedeker. You would make
Moses-when-the-light-went-out look like a
torchlight procession!</p>

<p>Not that I cite Herr Karl Baedeker as
the model of stellar perfection. Too many
stars may prove as demoralizing as too many
cooks. Even that guide, topographer and
friend of the tourist is at times bewildering,
if not misleading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>On page 133 of Baedeker’s Berlin, “<i>Furniture
From the Boudoir of Queen Marie
Antoinette</i>” has two stars, ** while “<i>Elijah
in the Desert</i>,” on page 108, has, in addition
to all his other troubles, to worry along with
one star.</p>

<p>And that is not the worst of it.</p>

<p>On page 163, “<i>a well-preserved Archæopteryx
in Solnhofen slate</i>,” to me by all odds
the most interesting object in Berlin, has no
star at all! * * *</p>

<p>But no matter how annoying it is, you
must never blame the Asterisks. They only
did as they were told and stood where Herr
Baedeker placed them and, if they did
wrong, Herr Baedeker alone was responsible.
A good writer—or editor—is good to
his Asterisks, and when he puts them in a
false position we must make due allowance.</p>

<p>If Asterisks could combine and form a
protective union, there might be some hope
for them, but a flair for collective bargaining
is not in their nature. That being the
case, I suggest the establishment of a Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Licensing Bureau empowered to investigate
the qualifications of would-be employers
of Asterisks and issue or withhold
licenses accordingly.</p>

<p>And it is high time something were done
about it.</p>

<p>Only lately there has been brought to my
notice a case of so flagrant a nature that,
were there such an institution as a Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Asterisks,
I should feel it my duty to call their attention
to it.</p>

<p>To come down to brass tacks, as the saying
is, the flagrant case of cruelty to Asterisks,
to which I refer, consists of a fat
book, called “The Best Short Stories of
1921.” Edited by Edward J. O’Brien—Published
by Small Maynard.</p>

<p>Never, I think, were a mob of overworked
employees so pitifully huddled together in
an ill-ventilated factory as are the Asterisks
in this Sweatshop of Twaddle.</p>

<p>The Sweatshop proper—if a Sweatshop
may be so qualified—is situated in the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the book, occupying about a fifth of its
volume, and consists of:</p>

<p>A Bibliographical Roll of Honor of
American Short Stories for 1920 and 1921
in which “<i>the best stories are indicated by
an Asterisk</i>.”</p>

<p>A Roll of Honor of Foreign Short
Stories in American Magazines in which
“<i>Stories of special excellence are indicated
by an Asterisk</i>.”</p>

<p>Volumes of short stories published in the
United States. “<i>An Asterisk before a title
indicates distinction.</i>”</p>

<p>Volumes of short stories published in
England and Ireland. “<i>An Asterisk before
a title indicates distinction.</i>”</p>

<p>Volumes of Short Stories published in
France. “<i>An Asterisk before a title, etc.</i>”
Follows then a list of articles on the Short
Story and last of all An Index of Short
Stories in Books, and here the Asterisks are
forced to work overtime and Mr. O’Brien’s
English gets a bit sloppy. He says:</p>

<p>“<i>Three Asterisks prefixed to a title indicate</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the more or less permanent <i>literary
value of the story</i>.”</p>

<p>“More or less permanent” reminds me of
an advertisement I once saw in a street car:
“Face Powder makes your complexion <i>more
irresistible</i>.” Is it possible that Mr.
O’Brien wrote it?</p>

<p>In the division entitled Magazine Averages,
Mr. O’Brien comes another cropper
with “<i>Three Asterisk stories are of</i> somewhat
permanent <i>literary value</i>.” Again, in
the introduction, “<i>Sherwood Anderson has
made this year once more the</i> most permanent
<i>contribution to the American Short
Story</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. O’Brien’s invention of varying degrees
of permanence is an important contribution
to science and entitles him to receive
at the very least the Order of the
Golden Asterisk of the Second Class with
Palms.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>Such, in brief, is the Sweatshop in the
rear where the toiling Asterisks labor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
weary shifts of one, two and three, pounding
out asinine averages and percentages of
permanency and near-permanency and plu-permanency
with a zeal that would do credit
to the framer of a Volstead Act.</p>

<p>Now let us walk round to the front of the
Factory, where in his cosy business office
which he calls the “Introduction” the Foreman
of the works, Mr. Edward J. O’Brien,
will tell us in the airy argon of the shop all
about the Fictional Flivvers—in which he
is a second-hand dealer—how they are made,
what they are worth and, if permanent, just
how long their permanence will last.</p>

<p>As Foreman O’Brien warms up to his
subject he will describe in vitally pulsating
phrases that would drive a movie writer mad
with envy, the convulsion of Nature that attended
the birth of the American Short
Story. “<i>The ever-widening seething maelstrom
of cross currents thrusting into more
and more powerful conflict from year to
year the contributory elements brought to a
new American culture by the dynamic creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
energies, physical and spiritual, of
many races</i>.”</p>

<p>All of which speechifying translated into
plain talk conveys the astounding information
that the hooch of American Fiction is
being brewed in the much-advertised Melting
Pot! Well, why couldn’t he say so and
be done with it?</p>

<p>Speaking of the Anglo-Saxon he says:
“<i>The Anglo-Saxon was beginning to absorb
large tracts of other racial fields of
memory and to share the experience of
Scandinavian and Russian and German and
Italian and Polish and Irish and African
and Asian members of the body politic.</i>”
The Melting Pot again! What did I tell
you! Continuing, Mr. O’Brien describes
the process of fermentation as a new chaos
set up by tracts of remembered racial experience
interacting upon one another under
the tremendous pressure of our nervous,
keen and eager civilization. He doesn’t
explain exactly how a thing so completely
lacking in the elements of design as a chaos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
should be “set up” to get the best results.
All he tells us is that fresh chaos is good
material for American literature, and that
our Mr. Anderson and others are very busy
in a half unconscious way, trying to make
“worlds” out of it.</p>

<p>By “worlds” I take it Mr. O’Brien means
something vast and vague and “<i>vitally compelling</i>”
and “organic” that our Mr. Anderson
and others will fuse into American
Fiction “<i>in artistic crucibles of their own
devising</i>.”</p>

<p>On the whole, things look pretty bright
for the American Short Story, what with the
“fresh living current which flows through
the best American work, and the Psychological
and imaginative reality which American
writers have conferred upon it,” and the
“seething maelstrom of cross currents,” and
the “dynamic creative energies,” and above
all the <i>chaos</i>, the great American Chaos—fresh—unlimited—inexhaustible—ripe
for
the “artistic crucible,” in which it is soon to
be fused into a new cosmos of “organic fiction”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
by the White Headed Boy of the
Western World.</p>

<div class="starbreak3x4">*** *** *** ***</div>

<p>On the other hand, how gloomy the outlook
pictured by Mr. O’Brien for the Englishman
and the Scotchman and the Irishman!
“Living at home—writing out of a
background of racial memory and established
tradition.” It fairly gives me the
shivers. No wonder their fiction lacks compelling
vitality!</p>

<p>But wouldn’t you think that with all the
Chaos lying round loose in Europe these
days, the Scotchman at least would grab
enough of it to create a bonnie new world
of vitally compelling fiction for himself?
That’s what I thought, but it seems I
thought wrong. The Foreign Chaos differs
from the Domestic variety in that it is “an
end rather than a beginning, a Chaos in
which the Tower of Babel had fallen.”</p>

<p>Once more, to translate the O’Brien
speechifying into speech—for the benefit of
readers who are not movie fans—the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
brand of Chaos is fresh and the European
Chaos is stale.</p>

<p>The elemental principles underlying all
forms of creation are the same, whether you
are creating a short story or a buckwheat
cake. The same dynamic laws must be
obeyed.</p>

<p>You may have the very best possible formula
for the creation of a buckwheat cake
and the best crucible—I mean the most artistic
frying pan that can be bought; but
unless the contributory elements of heat,
butter and eggs are physically and spiritually
beyond reproach, your buckwheat cake
will be a failure.</p>

<p>So, too, you may have the most perfect
recipe for a short story—from Mr.
O’Brien’s own book—and you may have the
most vitally compelling Psychology—straight
from the farm—but if your Chaos
be of the European cold-storage brand instead
of the “strictly fresh,” or, better still,
“new-laid” domestic variety, your Short
Story will be—like most of those in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
O’Brien’s collection—quite unfit for human
consumption.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>That Mr. O’Brien is a scientist of the first
rank has been amply proved by his startling
invention of comparative Permanence—see
Roll of Honor—but, though it is interesting
to know that by the use of Asterisks what
was once believed to be the essential characteristic
of Permanence can be modified, I
doubt if half of one per cent Permanence
will ever become popular.</p>

<p>But Mr. O’Brien has made another and
more practical contribution to science.</p>

<p>He has computed by means of Asterisks,
that thirty-eight short stories by American
authors “would not occupy more space than
five novels of average length.”</p>

<p>What a priceless boon to the budding
author about to embark upon his first short
story!</p>

<p>All he has to do is to borrow five novels
of average length, cut out the pages and
divide the total number into seven equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
piles, each one of which will be seven and
three-fifths of the total pile.</p>

<p>Six of these piles he may throw away or
return to the friends who loaned them—or
the Public Library, as the case may be. He
must then take the seventh pile and placing
the pages end to end on the floor—the roof
of the house will do if the floor be too small—and
procuring a strip of paper of exactly
the same length, begin the Story at one end
and continue writing until he reaches the
other end.</p>

<p>This will insure the work’s being of the
right length for an American Short Story,
and, if Mr. O’Brien’s other two conditions
as to “form and substance” are properly
fulfilled, the Story will be quite all right and
may be published—with three Asterisks—in
the Roll of Honor for the following year.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>The luncheon hour at the O’Brien Sweatshop
is devoted to an Efficiency Drill of all
the Asterisks employed.</p>

<p>The Drill lasts an hour and is designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
keep the Asterisks in perfect physical condition
for their arduous work.</p>

<p>First, there is a grand march of Asterisks
in varying formations of ones, twos and
threes. This is followed by running matches
and exhibitions of high jumping, wrestling
and leaping through hoops.</p>

<p>An exciting game of Roll of Honor closes
the exercises.</p>

<p>This is the most violent exercise of all and
consists of rolling blindfold down an inclined
plane and landing in a huge pile of
short stories.</p>

<p>The Asterisk that picks up the best Short
Story, receives as a reward an honorable
mention in the Annual Report.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>There have been many unkind things said
about the late-lamented year Nineteen
Twenty-One, but after inspecting this work
of Edward J. O’Brien’s I am inclined to
think that the title proclaiming it to be a
collection of Nineteen Twenty-One’s best
Short Stories, is the most slanderous statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of them all. It is enough to make even
the Statue of Liberty blush!</p>

<p>In no English-speaking country is the
Short Story such a recognized feature of
everyday social intercourse as it is in America.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible for two Americans
to meet anywhere or at any time of the day
or night without an exchange of Short
Stories. Sometimes the form of the telling
is good, sometimes bad. More often it is
very bad form indeed, but two things the
Story must have—to “get over”—substance
and brevity.</p>

<p>The same two things are demanded in the
written story. I do not include Form, because
Form is essential to Brevity. Artistic
Brevity cannot be achieved without Form.</p>

<p>Substance, to paraphrase the Bard, is
such stuff as Stories are made on. It must
be of good weave, or the story will not hold
together.</p>

<p>Some of the Stories in the O’Brien collection
are of a rotten fabric, others, while well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
woven, have a most disagreeable pattern.
Others again are dyed with imported dyes
from Kipling, Conrad and Company. At
least one of the stories has no fabric at all,
but the weaver—like the Weaver in the
Fairy Tales—has gone through the motions
of weaving so plausibly, not to say impudently,
that many, like Mr. O’Brien, are
deceived by it.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Brien, defining Substance, tells us
that it amounts to nothing unless it be organic
substance “<i>in which the pulse of life
is beating</i>.” Thereby he admits that Substance
is Stuff, but insists that it must be
Live Stuff!</p>

<p>Mr. O’Brien is mistaken; in one of the
finest Short Stories ever written the Substance
of the Story is a Shadow!</p>

<p>The Story is by “Anderson.”</p>

<p>What, <i>our</i> Mr. Anderson?</p>

<p>Great Heavens, no! Hans Christian Andersen.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>I have not the space to speak in detail of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
more than one of the Stories in Mr.
O’Brien’s collection, nor will it be necessary;
one specimen of the deadly <i>Amonita Bulbosa</i>
in a mess of mushrooms is enough to
justify the partaker thereof in damning the
whole dish, if he live to express any opinion
at all; so, if in a collection that claims to be
composed of “Best Short Stories” I find one
that is very bad in both Substance and
Form, indeed so bad in Substance that it
hardly deserves to be called a Story at all, I
may surely, with perfect justice, damn the
whole book as being false to its title and not
what it pretends to be.</p>

<p>But in censuring Mr. Anderson’s story
“Brothers,” I am not so much criticizing the
author as admonishing the compiler of “The
Best Stories” for the gross misuse of an
Asterisk.</p>

<p>One does not have to be an officer of the
S. P. C. A. to rebuke a truck driver who is
abusing a horse that is hitched to a truckload
of junk that is much too heavy for it.</p>

<p>By the same token, I do not pose as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
critic when I take Mr. O’Brien to task for
hitching an Asterisk to Sherwood Anderson’s
story, “Brothers.”</p>

<p>I should not have noticed the Anderson
load of junk, but for the stupidity of its
driver, which annoys me.</p>

<p>It is no way to treat an Asterisk.</p>

<div class="starbreak5">* * * * *</div>

<p>The kindest thing that can be said of
“Brothers” is that its inclusion in a collection
of American Short Stories puts it in a
false position. It is unmistakably American—the
mark of the “Melting Pot” is all
over it—and I suppose it is Short, though it
takes a lot of patience to read it, but it is <i>not</i>
a story in the accepted sense of the word.</p>

<p>It starts nowhere, it does nothing and it
gets nowhere, reminding one vaguely of the
three Japanese monkeys who see nothing,
hear nothing and say nothing.</p>

<p>To apply the O’Brien test, it has no Substance.
The weaver went through the motions
of weaving, but he wove nothing.
There is no “stuff” here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither has it Form. The material—such
as it is—is not shaped “into the most beautiful
and satisfying form by skillful selection
and arrangement.” That is to say, it violates
Mr. O’Brien’s own rule.</p>

<p>If I were asked to give the thing a name,
I should say that “Brothers” is a sort of
cross between a very dull parody of one of
G. S. Street’s “Episodes” and a grimy but
ambitious newspaper “story” touched up
with a dash of that old-fashioned freak of
lap-dog literature known as the “Poem in
Prose,” much petted by Turgenieff in the
early eighties, a vehicle—if one may be permitted
to change similes in midstream—in
which you pay as you enter and as you leave,
both.</p>

<p>You pay as you enter with a soddenly
self-conscious rhapsody in G minor, and you
pay as you leave with a tiresome repetition
of the same.</p>

<p>When a Story of the O’Brien school begins
like that, you feel sure it is going to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to something disgusting and you are seldom
disappointed, certainly not in this instance.</p>

<p>It is a sort of elegy on the falling leaves.</p>

<p>Mr. Anderson almost weeps for pity of
the falling leaves. Listen to the patter of
the Andersonian tears:</p>

<p>“* * * the yellow, red and golden leaves
fall straight down heavily. The rain beats
them brutally down. They are denied a last
golden flash across the sky. In October,
leaves should be carried away, out over the
plains, in a wind. They should go dancing
away.”</p>

<p>You have a feeling as you read this, that
Mr. A. rather fancies it himself. You can
almost hear him say: “I do this fallen-leaf
stuff rather well, if you know what I mean!”
and since it is the only pretty bit in the
Story, you hardly blame him for repeating
it at the end.</p>

<p>For my part, I am suspicious; I am not
from Missouri, but, nevertheless, I require
to be shown.</p>

<p>I ask myself: “Is Mr. Anderson sincere?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>I read further on, and I find that he is not.</p>

<p>This is what I read:</p>

<p>“* * * His arms tightened about the
body of the little dog so that it screamed
with pain. I stepped forward and tore the
arms away, and the dog fell to the ground
and lay whining. No doubt it had been injured.
Perhaps ribs had been crushed. The
old man stared at the dog lying at his feet.”</p>

<p>Nothing more about the little dog until, a
few lines further on, Mr. Anderson shows
that the dying agony of a little dog excited
only a passing interest in him. “An hour
ago the old man of the house in the forest
went past my door and the little dog was not
with him. It may be that as we talked in the
fog he crushed the life out of his companion.
It may be that the dog, like the workman’s
wife and her unborn child, is now dead.
The leaves of the trees that line the road
before my window are falling like rain—the
yellow, red and golden leaves fall straight
down heavily * * *,” and so on, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
repetition of the opening rhapsody of grief
for the falling leaves.</p>

<p>So, you see, to Sherwood Anderson a falling
leaf is a heart-rending sight, but a falling
puppy, even though its ribs be crushed
and it scream with agony, is quite another
thing.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Anderson is not sincere.</p>

<p>And if an artist, though he fairly reek
with seething dynamic chaos and vitally
compelling psychology, have not sincerity,
all the Asterisks in Mr. O’Brien’s sweatshop
will avail him naught.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
